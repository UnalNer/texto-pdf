Objectives Mutations affecting the TMEM173 gene cause STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). No
standard immunosuppressive treatment approach is able to control disease progression in patients with SAVI. We studied the
efficacy and safety of targeting type I IFN signaling with the Janus kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib.
Methods We used DNA sequencing to identify mutations in TMEM173 in patients with peripheral blood type I IFN signature.
The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was administered on an off-label basis.
Results We identified three patients with SAVI presenting with skin involvement and progressive severe interstitial lung disease.
Indirect echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension were present in one case. Following treatment with ruxolitinib, we
observed improvements of respiratory function including increased forced vital capacity in two patients, with discontinuation of
oxygen therapy and resolution of echocardiographic abnormalities in one case. Efficacy was persistent in one patient and only
transitory in the other two patients. Clinical control of skin complications was obtained, and one patient discontinued steroid

treatment. One patient, who presented with kidney involvement, showed resolution of hematuria. One patient experienced
increased recurrence of severe viral respiratory infections. Monitoring of peripheral blood type I interferon signature during
ruxolitinib treatment did not show a stable decrease.
Conclusions We conclude that targeting type I IFN receptor signaling may represent a promising therapeutic option for a subset
of patients with SAVI syndrome and severe lung involvement. However, the occurrence of viral respiratory infection might
represent an important cautionary note for the application of such form of treatment.

Type I interferonopathies are a new class of disorders linked to
the upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) [1, 2]. Stimulator of
IFN genes (STING)-associated vasculopathy with onset in
infancy (SAVI) is caused by gain of function mutations in
TMEM173 [3], which lead to a constitutive production of
high levels of type I IFNs without infectious triggers [3–5].
SAVI is characterized by systemic inflammation, chronic anemia, growth failure, cutaneous necrotic lesions, and interstitial
lung disease [3, 6]. Low-titer autoantibodies (i.e., anti-nuclear
antibody, anti-cardiolipin antibodies) can also be present.
Therapeutic management is challenging: steroids are partially
effective; patients respond poorly to disease-modifying therapies, such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, antimalarials, infliximab, and rituximab [3, 6, 7]. Prognosis is
poor especially in patients with a severe lung involvement,
with a high mortality in the first two decades of life [3].
In light of the encouraging results obtained with the use of
JAK inhibitors in other interferonopathies [8], and the ability
of blocking type I IFN pathway activation in SAVI PBMC
in vitro [3], a few SAVI patients have been treated with
JAK1/2 inhibitors with good responses [9, 10].
We describe three SAVI patients with severe pulmonary
involvement in which treatment with the JAK1/2 inhibitor,
ruxolitinib, led to marked amelioration of disease manifestations that was sustained in one patient, but only transient in the
other two.
