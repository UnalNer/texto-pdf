The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has
caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from
the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 0 0 0 conﬁrmed cases have been
identiﬁed in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the
WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is
closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and
infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia
or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common ﬁnding from computed tomography images of the
chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now
undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2
is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the
situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better
we can respond.

1. Introduction
Since the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) infection in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1], it has
rapidly spread across China and many other countries [2–8]. So
far, 2019-nCoV has affected more than 43 0 0 0 patients in 28 countries/regions and has became a major global health concern (https:
//www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/
20200211- sitrep- 22- ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9_4). On 11 February
2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new

name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus
disease (COVID-19). Regarding the virus itself, the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the previously provisionally named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3].
Although early studies reported a link between a single local
ﬁsh and wild animal market and most cases of infection, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission, studies have increasingly demonstrated human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
through droplets or direct contact [2,8–10]. Moreover, according to
one study, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2
was suspected in 41% of patients [8]. Based on the evidence of a
rapidly increasing incidence of infections [11] and the possibility
of transmission by asymptomatic carriers [12], SARS-CoV-2 can be
transmitted effectively among humans and exhibits high potential

for a pandemic [5,10,13]. In addition to the high transmission eﬃciency of SARS-CoV-2, the advancement and convenience of global
travel could further enhance its worldwide spread [12]. On 30
January 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the
sixth public health emergency of international concern, following
H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016)
and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019). Therefore,
health workers, governments and the public need to co-operate
globally to prevent its spread [14].
2. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
In addition to seasonal inﬂuenza, reported pathogens of pneumonia include adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human
bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainﬂuenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus A/B [15–18]. Moreover,
these viruses can cause co-infection in the setting of communityacquired bacterial pneumonia [16–18]. Using molecular methods,
knowledge about the role of these viruses in the setting of
pneumonia has achieved signiﬁcant advancements [19–21]. SARSCoV-2 was found to be a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
virus belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus [22–24]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (88–
89% similarity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, namely
bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession no. MG772933.1) and batSL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank accession no. MG772934.1), but it is
more distant from SARS-CoV (~79% similarity) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (~50% similarity)
[23,25,26]. Chen et al. applied an RNA-based metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing approach to identify a human coronavirus
from two pneumonia cases during the Wuhan outbreak in 2019
[27]. Its entire genome was 29 881 bp in length [27]. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the coronavirus circulating in Rhinolophus (horseshoe bats), with 98.7% nucleotide similarity to the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) gene of the bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank
KP876546, 370 bp sequence of RdRp) and 87.9% nucleotide similarity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S and N genes suggests
that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely a novel coronavirus that was independently introduced from animals to humans [27]. Based on the
ﬁndings of genomic investigations and the presence of some bats
and live animals in the seafood market in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 may
have originated from bats or bat droppings associated with contaminated materials in the market or surrounding region [25,28].
3. Epidemiology
Based on observations of data from the early outbreak in mainland China from 10–24 January 2020, the trend of an increasing
incidence largely follows exponential growth, and the mean basic
reproduction number (R0 ) was estimated to range from 2.24 [95%
conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.96–2.55] to 3.58 (95% CI 2.89–4.39), associated with two- to eight-fold increases in the reporting rate [11].
Another estimation based on data from 31 December 2019 to 28
January 2020 suggested similar ﬁndings, with the R0 for COVID-19
being 2.68 [95% credible interval (CrI) 2.47–2.86] and the epidemic
doubling time being 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8–7.1 days) [29]. The current estimate of the mean incubation period for COVID-19 is 6.4
days, ranging from 2.1 days to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
[30], with potential asymptomatic transmission. Although the situation is evolving and further updated data are required to conﬁrm
these estimations, there is great potential for a large outbreak of
COVID-19 soon.
As of 11 February 2020, data from the WHO showed that there
were a total of 43 103 cases of COVID-19 (Figs 1 and 2) (https:

//www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/
20200211- sitrep- 22- ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9_4). There has been
a steady rise in the daily total number of COVID-19 cases globally,
both within and outside China (Fig. 1). Regarding new cases of
COVID-19, a declining trend was found globally (Fig. 2A), in China
but not outside China (Fig. 2B), mainly in international conveyance
(Japan) on 11 February 2020. Twenty-eight countries/regions have
reported conﬁrmed cases, including mainland China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Thailand,
South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the
USA, Macao SAR, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, France, the
Philippines, the UK, Italy, India, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Sri Lanka,
Cambodia, Nepal, Spain and Belgium. China has had the largest
number of patients with COVID-19 (n = 42 690), followed by Singapore (n = 45) (Fig. 3A). Asia has had most of the reported cases,
followed by Europe, North America and Australia, but no cases
have been reported in Africa. Within China, Hubei has endured
the largest number of infected patients (n = 31 728), followed by
Guangdong (n = 1177), Zhejiang (n = 1117) and Henan (n = 1105)
(Fig. 3B). A total of 1017 mortalities have been reported globally,
with only 2 mortalities occurring outside of mainland China, one
each in Hong Kong SAR and the Philippines. According to the
Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En),
as of 12 February 2020 there were 45 167 cases of COVID-19
reported from 28 countries/region and 1115 (2.5%) of patients
had died. Among the 45 167 cases, most were found in mainland China (n = 44 653) and the reported mortality was 2.5%
(n = 1113).

4. Clinical manifestations
As of 10 February 2020, only three relatively large-scale case
studies have thoroughly demonstrated the clinical features of
patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia) in Wuhan [4,5,8]. Herein, we summarise the clinical
manifestations of the 278 pooled patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is also referred to as novel coronavirus pneumonia
or Wuhan pneumonia (Table 1). All of the patients were adults
older than 18 years of age, and males comprised 61.9% of the patients (n = 172). A recent study in Beijing reported that 2 of the 13
patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were children aged between
2–15 years [9]. As of 10 February 2020, more than 20 paediatric
cases have been reported in China, 10 of whom were identiﬁed
in Zhejiang Province and were in the age range of 112 days to 17
years [31]. Among adult patients, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were the most common underlying diseases, followed by
diabetes mellitus. Fever was the most common symptom (92.8%;
n = 258), followed by cough (69.8%; n = 194), dyspnoea (34.5%;
n = 96), myalgia (27.7%; n = 77), headache (7.2%; n = 20) and diarrhoea (6.1%; n = 17). Rhinorrhoea was noted in only 4.0% [4], a sore
throat in 5.1% [4] and pharyngalgia in 17.4% [8] of patients with
relevant clinical information. Most patients had a normal white
blood cell count, but 56.8% (n = 158) of patients had leukopenia.
In one study, patients requiring intensive care were signiﬁcantly
older and more likely to have underlying diseases [8], but another
study showed different ﬁndings [5]. According to two studies, patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were more likely
to have dyspnoea than non-ICU patients [5,8]. Among the 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia reported in Beijing, 12 (92.3%)
had fever with a mean duration of 1.6 days before hospitalisation
[9]. Other symptoms included cough (46.3%), upper airway congestion (61.5%), myalgia (23.1%) and headache (23.1%) [9]. Although
some of the epidemiological characteristics were identiﬁed, considerable uncertainties are still present and additional studies are
needed with detailed information from conﬁrmed cases [32].

(B) daily numbers of cases from China [including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Macau SAR] and outside of China.

5. Imaging
Radiological ﬁndings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are variable.
More than 75% of patients presented with bilateral lung involvement [4,5,8,32], and multilobe involvement was also common
(71%) [33]. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the most common
ﬁnding from chest computed tomography (CT) [8,34], and in a series of 21 patients, 86% had GGO on chest CT and 29% showed
consolidation [33]. Approximately one-third of patients showed a
peripheral distribution of GGO. In contrast, no discrete nodules,
cavitation, pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy were observed on
the chest CT images [33,34]. Another study including 51 cases
showed similar ﬁndings [35]: most CT images showed pure GGO

(77%), followed by GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal
thickening (75%), GGO with consolidation (59%) and pure consolidation (55%). Of the 51 cases, 86% showed bilateral lung involvement, and the above ﬁndings were peripherally distributed in 86%
of cases [35].
6. Potential treatment options
According to recent reports [4,5,8], >85% of patients received
antiviral agents, including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h orally),
ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 h intravenously) and lopinavir/ritonavir
tablets (40 0/10 0 mg twice daily orally). Empirical antibiotics
were prescribed for 90% of patients in three reports [4,5,8], and

according to one study 15 patients (15%) received antifungal agents
[4]. Five cases (5.1%) of bacterial (n = 1) or Candida (n = 4) coinfections were reported among 99 patients in one study [4], and
4 cases (9.8%) of secondary bacterial infections were reported in
another study of 41 patients [5] (Table 2). Although intravenous
immunoglobulin and systemic steroids have been used in several
reports [4,5,8], their eﬃcacy and associated adverse effects remain
unclear.
So far, there has been no effective treatment of COVID-19.
Several potential drug candidates, including lopinavir/ritonavir
R
(Kaletra
), nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdeR
sivir, umifenovir (Arbidol
), DNA synthesis inhibitors (such as

tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine), chloroquine and Chinese
traditional medicines (such as ShuFeng JieDu or Lianhua Qingwen capsules), have been proposed [36,37]. In addition, an
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-based peptide, 3CLpro inhibitor (3CLpro-1) and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor, theoretically, appear to show potential for antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 [38]. Chloroquine has been well described with in
vitro effects on inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of posttranslational modiﬁcations of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation in many viruses, including
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) [39]. Preliminary in vivo
clinical studies suggest that chloroquine alone or in combination

with antiretroviral agents might play an interesting role in treating HIV infection [39]. A recent study by Wang et al. revealed that
remdesivir and chloroquine were highly effective in the control
of 2019-nCoV in vitro [37]. In addition to the one case of SARSCoV-2 pneumonia with a promising clinical response to remdesivir
[7] and two clinical trials in China, further case-controlled clinical
studies of remdesivir therapy are warranted to verify its therapeutic eﬃcacy.
7. Outcomes
In the three pooled studies of 278 patients [4,5,8], 72 patients (25.9%) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required ICU admission, 56 (20.1%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and
23 (8.3%) and 9 (3.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia,
respectively (Table 2). Shock was observed in 19 patients (6.8%),
acute kidney injury in 11 patients (4.0%) and continuous renal replacement therapy was required in 14 patients (5.0%). Acute cardiac injury was reported in 5 patients (12.2%) in one study [5] and
10 patients (7.2%) in another study [8]. Although two earlier studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was associated with
high mortality rates of 11.1% (n = 11) [4] and 14.6% (n = 6) [5], one
recent study showed a mortality rate of 4.3% (n = 6) [8] (Table 2).
Among 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia outside of Wuhan,
as of 4 February 2020 all of the patients recovered but 12 were still
being quarantined in hospital in Beijing [9]. It might be suggested
that the real-world mortality rate may be lower than that reported
in a few published clinical series, when clinical data from more
systematic testing would be available, and as the ratio between
fatality cases and total reported cases of COVID-19 on 12 February 2020 was currently 0.025 (mortality rate 2.5%). However, most
deaths developed in male and elderly patients [4,40]. The median
number of days from the appearance of the ﬁrst symptom to death
was 14 days, and it was signiﬁcantly shorter among patients aged
≥70 years (11.5 days) compared with those aged <70 years (20
days) (P = 0.033) [40].
8. Infection control and prevention
To decrease the damage associated with COVID-19, public
health and infection control measures are urgently required to
limit the global spread of the virus [35]. Experience from the early
phase of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia strongly highlighted that travel
history, rather than chest radiography, is of paramount importance
for early detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases
[41]. It is essential to limit human-to-human transmission in order
to reduce secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers and to prevent transmission ampliﬁcation events and
further international spread from China. Based on previous experience of management of MERS and SARS infections, the WHO recommend infection control interventions to reduce the general risk
of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including avoiding
close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand-washing especially after direct contact with
ill people or their environment, and avoiding unprotected contact
with farm or wild animals. Moreover, people with symptoms of
acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette, which
is to maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands, and within healthcare
facilities enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices are recommended in hospitals, especially in emergency departments [42]. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established interim clinical guidance for the COVID19 outbreak to implement aggressive measures to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA [43]. These measures include

7

identiﬁcation of cases and their contacts in the USA as well as
appropriate assessment and care of travellers arriving from mainland China to the USA [43]. All efforts are being made to slow the
spread of the illness in order to provide time to better prepare
healthcare systems and the general public, to better characterise
COVID-19 to guide public-health recommendations, and to develop
timely diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines [43]. Finally, although
the improvement of internet communication largely enhances the
availability and dissemination of knowledge, the internet also has
the potential for the development and spread of misinformation or
fake news. Governments should be responsible for providing accurate knowledge and clarifying misinformation to help the public
face this novel infection.
9. Unresolved issues
Despite the whole world’s efforts to understand COVID-19,
many issues remain unclear. First, one report has demonstrated the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stools [7]. However, whether
SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the faecal–oral route remains unclear. Second, previous studies showed that SARS-CoV and
other coronaviruses could survive on environmental surfaces and
inanimate objects [44,45]; however, the presence of SARS-CoV-2
in the environment has not been reported. Previous studies have
shown that coronaviruses could be eﬃciently inactivated using surface disinfectants with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or
0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min, but other biocidal agents
such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine
digluconate were less effective [45]. However, current investigation
of the eﬃcacy of commonly used disinfection agents against SARSCoV-2 is lacking. Third, although travel restriction was exerted in
many countries, whether this intervention was effective is unclear.
Fourth, although one case responded well to remdesivir [7] and
one in vitro study [37] showed that remdesivir and chloroquine
were promising for the treatment of COVID-19, further clinical trials on the effectiveness of remdesivir and chloroquine for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia should be conducted. Fifth, although
several studies have reported the clinical features of COVID-19
[4,5,8,9], all of the patients had pneumonia and were treated in
Wuhan and Beijing. Most recently, an article has described 1099
patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by SARS-CoV2 treated at 552 hospitals across 31 provinces/provincial municipalities in China [46]. The article reported that only 43.8% of patients had a initial presentation of fever, and severe pneumonia
occurred in 15.7% of cases. The study indicated the median incubation period to be 3.0 days (range, 0–24.0 days) and the fatality rate
to be only 1.36% [46]. However, further evaluation of the content of
the above report is warranted to clarify the epidemiological and
clinical characteristics of asymptomatic carriers and of ARD and
pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, although 32.4% (n = 90)
of the reported 278 cases with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia received
systemic steroid therapy [4,5,8], a study on the temporal features
of the SARS-CoV-2-induced inﬂammatory response in relation to
the timing of therapeutic interventions is lacking. Previous experiences of systemic steroids in the treatment of coronavirus-related
infections, such as SARS and MERS, showed disappointing results.
In the interim, clinical use of glucocorticoids to control SARS-CoV2 pneumonia with the intention of regulating cytokine production
and the inﬂammatory response and avoiding lung injury should be
avoided [47,48].
10. Conclusions
The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a clinical threat to the
general population and healthcare workers worldwide. However,

8

knowledge about this novel virus remains limited. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. What we can do now is aggressively implement infection control measures to prevent the spread of SARSCoV-2 via human-to-human transmission. Public health authorities
should keep monitoring the situation, as the more we learn about
this novel virus and its associated outbreaks, the better we can respond.
