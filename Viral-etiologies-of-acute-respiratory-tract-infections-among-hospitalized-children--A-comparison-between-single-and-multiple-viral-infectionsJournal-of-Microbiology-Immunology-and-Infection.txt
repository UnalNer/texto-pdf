Abstract Background: Acute respiratory tract infections are commonly caused by viruses in
children. The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had
fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data
were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in
upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared.
Results: A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N Z 311)
had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p Z 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection
(p Z 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (p Z 0.019) than those with negative viral
detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single
viral infection; however, there were no significant differences in duration of fever, antibiotics
treatment and hospitalization between these two groups.
The most commonly identified virus was human rhinovirus. About 27% (n Z 83) of patients
had multiple viral infections. Overall, the highest percentage of human bocavirus infection
was detected in multiple viral infections (79%). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was

(RSV) infection (p Z 0.001) and longer hospitalization duration (p Z 0.011).
Conclusion: Multiple viral infections were associated with younger age and a higher risk of
developing LRTI. However, multiple viral infections did not predict a worse disease outcome.
More studies are needed to unveil the interplay between the hosts and different viruses in multiple viral infections.

Introduction
Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a leading cause of
fever and hospitalization in children worldwide.1 Upper
respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most frequent
human illness and the most common disease in childhood;
on average, infants and preschoolers develop six to eight
URTIs per year.2 URTIs can cause non-severe but widespread epidemics that are responsible for the continuous
circulation of pathogens in the community. Moreover, lower
respiratory tract infection (LRTI) may also develop severe
disease and is the leading infectious cause of death in
children younger than five years of age.3 For both URTI and
LRTI, viral infection is the primary cause, especially in
children. Clinically, the febrile presentation could lead to
the use of more diagnostic tools and antibiotics. Therefore,
accurate and timely identification of the responsible viral
pathogen could reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics and
length of hospital stay.4
Multiple viral infections are more commonly seen in
pediatric patients than in adults.5 Multiple viral infections
were reported to be associated with increased hospital
admissions, intensive care unit admissions, lengthened
duration of hospitalization, and prolonged mechanical
ventilation use.6e8 However, some studies indicated that
disease severity, management, and outcome were not

associated with multiple viral infections.9e12 Interestingly,
a study published by Martin et al. revealed that illnesses
with multiple virus detections were correlated with disease
of less severity.13 Hence, whether multiple viral infections
correlate with disease severity remains unclear.
In comparison to traditional viral culture and polymerase
chain reaction detection for each viral pathogen, the
Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) assay offers
simultaneous testing for several common respiratory viruses with improved diagnostic sensitivity along with comparable sensitivity to individual real-time nucleic acid
tests.14 The sensitivity and specificity of RVP were reported
to be 95.2% and 99.6%, respectively.15 Furthermore, RVP
can detect the presence of new viral pathogens which are
not routinely cultivated or tested in clinical laboratories,
such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV), and human bocavirus (HBoV).
In this study, we aim to analyze the clinical data of
hospitalized children who were febrile and had a RVP test
and compare the differences between patients with negative, single and multiple detections for viral pathogens. The
viral etiologies contributing to single or multiple infections
were compared as well as the data of patients with URTI
and LRTI.

Materials and methods
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records
of hospitalized patients with a report of xTAG RVP from
December 30, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Those enrolled
patients had fever with or without respiratory symptoms on
the general ward or intensive care unit (ICU) of Taipei
Veterans General Hospital. RVPs were performed to investigate the possible viral etiology. Of note, three rapid antigen tests, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), and adenovirus (HAdV) were available on the ward. If
one of the quick antigen tests came back positive, further
RVP test may not be conducted. The clinical characteristics, laboratory data, comorbidities (congenital heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic neurological
disease, prematurity, malignancy), clinical diagnosis,
duration of antibiotics use, ICU admission and duration
hospitalization of the patients were recorded. Patients
were divided into three age groups (2 years old; > 2
and 5 years old; >5 years old).

For further comparison of the differences between patients with URTI and LRTI, acute rhinitis, pharyngitis,
laryngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media (AOM), acute sinusitis and
croup were categorized as URTI whilst LRTI included acute
bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Patients with
positive results of Mycoplasma pneumoniae serum IgM,
urinary pneumococcal antigen, or bacterial culture results
from blood, urine, or sputum were recorded as evidence of
bacterial infection. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital
(No. IRB:2018-02-014AC).

Respiratory virus detection
The extraction of nucleic acids from nasopharyngeal or
bronchoalveolar lavage specimens was done using QiaAmp
Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted
nucleic acids were immediately frozen at 80  C until
further testing. A commercial kit, xTAG RVP Fast Assay,
Version 2.0 (Luminex Molecular Diagnosis Inc. Toronto,
Canada), was used for respiratory viral detection. xTAG RVP
FAST v2 includes two controls (MS-2 and Lambda DNA) to
ensure assay performance. This kit allows simultaneous
screening for 18 common respiratory viral pathogens and
subtypes in the nucleic acid samples, including influenza A
virus (Flu A subtype H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1), influenza B
virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human

coronaviruses (HCoVs, NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1),
human parainfluenza viruses (PIV) type 1e4, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (EV/
HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human adenovirus
(HAdV). We further differentiated enterovirus from rhinovirus based on the symptoms, signs, and the confirmed
diagnosis. The duration of antibiotics treatment and hospitalization were also recorded.

Statistical analysis
The summarized statistical results of the baseline characteristics of the patients were expressed as counts and
percentages for categorical data and means with standard
deviation. Continuous variables were analyzed using an
independent t-test and one-way ANOVA, and categorical
variables by the Chi-square test. All comparisons were twotailed, and P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval
(CI) were calculated by univariate and multivariate logistic
regression. All statistical analyses were performed using
IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Results
A total of 442 samples were sent for RVP tests from our
pediatric ward during the study period with a positive rate

of 70%. There were 263 males (59.2%). No mortality was
recorded in our study.

Comparison of clinical characteristics, laboratory
data and outcome in patients with negative and
positive detection for viral pathogens
As shown in Table 1, 311 patients (mean age 2.68  2.88
years; range 3 dayse16 years old) had positive detection for
viral pathogens in comparison to 131 patients (mean age
4.21  5.28 years; range 2 dayse17 years old) with negative
detection. Patients without viral detection were older and
had longer duration of fever than those with positive
detection for viral pathogens. In multivariable analysis,
patients with positive viral detection had significantly lower
rate of leukocytosis (p Z 0.03), less evidence of bacterial
infection (OR Z 0.420, 95% CI 0.23e0.75, p Z 0.004), and
shorter duration of hospitalization (OR Z 0.947, 95% CI
0.90e0.99, p Z 0.019).

Comparison between single and multiple viral
infections
The clinical characteristics, laboratory data and outcome of
patients with single and multiple viral infections were
compared (Table 2). Multiple viral infections accounted for
27% (83/311) of patients with a positive RVP report whereas
228 patients had single viral detection. To minimize the
confounding effects of bacterial infection on outcome
analysis, we excluded patients with AOM, acute sinusitis,
and evidence of bacterial infection. As a result, the clinical
data of 188 patients with single viral infection and 69
Table 2

patients with multiple viral infections were compared. Using
a multivariable logistic regression model with adjustment by
comorbidity, patients with multiple viral infections were
younger (OR Z 0.812, 95% CI 0.70e0.96, p Z 0.015) than
those with single viral infection. Interestingly, there was no
statistically significant difference in the duration of fever,
antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between patients
with single and multiple viral infections.

Number of identified viruses and their presence in
multiple viral infections
As shown in Fig. 1, HRVs (36%, n Z 113) are the most
commonly identified virus among all the 311 patients, followed by RSVs (28%, n Z 88), and PIVs (22%, n Z 70).
Notably, HBoV was detected mainly in multiple viral infections (79%, 19/24), followed by HAdV (62%, 18/29) and
HRV (49%, 56/113). Among the 83 patients with multiple
viral infections, the most common combination of viral infections was RSV þ HRV 20.4% (17/83), followed by
HRV þ HBoV 8.4% (7/83) and HAdV þ HRV 8.4% (7/83)
(Supplemental Table 1). Moreover, dual viral pathogens
were detected in 23.1% (72/311) patients with viral infections, triple in 2.2% (7/311) and quadruple in 1.2% (4/
311) of patients.

Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, clinical
diagnosis and outcome of patients with single viral
infection
Next, we analyzed the clinical data of patients with single

(n Z 38), PIV4 (n Z 6) and non-typable PIV (n Z 1).

confounding effects of bacterial infection on outcome
analysis, patients with AOM, acute sinusitis and evidence of
bacterial infection were excluded. As a result, HAdV
infection was noted more in older children (5.65  3.56
years) whilst HBoV infected patients at a younger age
(0.88  0.09 years). Moreover, patients infected with HAdV
had a longer duration of fever (5.60  0.54 days) in comparison to the shorter duration of fever (2.00  1.00 days)
caused by HBoV infection. Notably, HAdV infection raised a
higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level (3.53  4.51 mg/dL).
There was no single viral pathogen correlating with longer
antibiotics treatment, more ICU admission or longer duration of hospitalization.

Comparison of clinical data, viral etiologies and
outcome between patients with URTI and LRTI
We further compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory data, clinical diagnosis, and outcome between URTI
and LTRI groups (Table 3). After patients with AOM, acute
sinusitis, herpangina and evidence of bacterial infection
were excluded from analysis, there were 58 and 167 patients in URTI and LRTI groups, respectively. Using multivariable logistic regression with comorbidity adjustment,
we identified three factors independently associated with
LRTI, including multiple viral infections (OR Z 2.996, 95% CI
1.17e7.65, p Z 0.022), RSV infection (OR Z 6.477, 95% CI
2.17e19.27, p Z 0.001), longer hospitalization duration
(OR Z 1.306, 95% CI 1.06e1.60, p Z 0.011). By contrast,
Flu-B infection (OR Z 0.060, 95% CI 0.006e0.57, p Z 0.015)
and HCoV infection (OR Z 0.255, 95% CI 0.06e0.96,
p Z 0.044) were independently associated with URTI.
There was no statistical difference in duration of fever, CRP

level, and duration of antibiotics treatment between URTI
and LRTI infections.

Discussion
In the present study, we analyzed the data of 442 hospitalized children who were febrile and had the xTAG RVP
test in a single medical center over a 2-year period. Patients with negative detection for viral pathogens had more
evidence of bacterial infection, higher white blood cell
count and longer duration of hospitalization in comparison
to patients with positive detection for viral pathogens.
The age of patients with multiple viral infections was
younger than those with single viral infection. Nevertheless, there was no difference in duration of fever and the
clinical outcome, including duration of antibiotics treatment and hospital stay, between these two groups of patients. These findings are consistent with recent systematic
reviews and meta-analyses which have concluded that
there was no significant difference between children with
single and multiple respiratory viral infections concerning
the clinical disease severity, the length of hospital stay,
admission to the intensive care unit, need for mechanical
ventilation, oxygen requirements, and death.11,16,17 By
contrast, some studies showed that multiple viral infections
increased the risk of ICU admission.18
Of note, the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses
does not necessarily implicate the pathogenic effect at the
time of detection, especially when molecular methods are
used. It is also difficult to distinguish between active viral
infection, viral shedding, and potentially non-pathogenic
viral infection. For instance, HBoV and HAdV may have
prolonged viral shedding.11 The detection of two viruses

may represent an episode of acute infection in the presence of other viral persistence from a recent infection.19
Moreover, the mechanisms of disease virulence and
viraleviral interaction in multiple infections are not clearly
understood. They may result from direct interactions of
viral genes or indirect interactions resulting from alterations in the host-environment or immunological interactions.20 Different pathogenic mechanisms may be
triggered by different viruses, which may potentiate or
inhibit the effects on each other. For instance, RSV or
influenza coinfection with other viruses may associate with
a worse outcome.7,21 Furthermore, some studies indicated
a high viral load is related to higher disease severity in
respiratory infections22; however, conflicting results have
been reported.23 Therefore, further studies are needed to
determine whether multiple viral infections contribute to
disease severity.

Of all the respiratory viruses analyzed, HRV, RSV, and PIV
were the most commonly identified viruses in descending
order. Previous studies have shown slightly different rankings of common respiratory pathogens; nevertheless, HRV
has consistently been the most common cause in all age
groups.24 Similar to results of previous studies, RSV and PIV
are the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children.25,26 HAdV is
accountable for around 10 percent of ARTI in children in the
previous study5 and it was 9% in our study. This was
underestimated because patients with a positive quick
adenovirus antigen test without proceeding to have xTAG
RVP testing were not included in our analysis. Six percent
(19/311) of children were reported positive for HCoV, of
which 2.5% were positive for OC43 (8/311), 2.2% for NL63
(7/311), 0.6% for 229E (2/311), and 0.6% for HKU1 (2/311).
These are similar to previous results.27

In this study, 27% of children had multiple viral infections. The result is similar to the previous studies that
detection of multiple viruses simultaneously in pediatric
patients ranges from 10 to 30%.28 Similar to previous findings, the three most commonly detected viruses in multiple
viral infections were HRV, RSV, and PIV in this study.10,29
Furthermore, higher percentages of HBoV (79%), HAdV
(62%), and HRV (49%) infection were present in children
with multiple viral infections. Previous studies showed that
around 33%e75% of HBoV was detected in children who had
co-infection with other viruses.30,31 According to the previous study by Lee et al., multiple respiratory viral infections with HAdV were reported in 30.5% of children.32
HRV was the most common co-infecting virus which occurring in 69.6% of multiple viral infections.33 In addition, the
most common combinations of multiple viral infections
were HRV þ RSV and HRV þ HAdV and triple/quadruple viral
infections accounted for a certain proportion similar to the
results of previous studies.11,33e35
HBoV infections occurred mostly in children less than 2
years of age with a mean age of 0.88  0.09 years. The
previous study indicated that HBoV circulates in the community and is acquired early in life.36 The clinical picture of
adenovirus infection was characterized by high grade and
prolonged fever. Laboratory findings of HAdV infections
include elevated CRP, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia.37 In
our study, HAdV had significantly longer fever duration
(5.60  0.54 days) and elevated CRP level (3.53  4.51 mg/
dl).
Flu-B infection and HCoV infection were independently
associated with URTI whereas multiple viral infections, RSV
infection, and longer hospitalization duration were independently associated with LRTI. To minimize the confounding effects of concurrent bacterial infection, we
excluded patients with AOM, acute sinusitis, and evidence
of bacterial infection. Those patients with a positive
influenza antigen test were not enrolled for analysis so the
case number was small. Previous studies have shown four
subtypes of HCoV (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1) lead to milder
URTI.38 On the other hand, RSV has been reported as the
primary pathogen causing LRTI and hospitalization in young
children.39 In our study, 90% of patients with positive RSV
detection had acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia.
There were several limitations to this study. Firstly,
those who had a positive quick antigen test result without
RVP testing were not included. That could explain why the
numbers of cases with adenovirus, RSV and influenza infections were smaller in comparison to previous studies.5,29
Secondly, the RVP was not a timely test as it might take
days to obtain the result. The delay might have contributed
to the prolonged course of antibiotics use or lengthened
hospital course due to fever. Thirdly, patients with bacterial co-infection but without evidence potentially have a
confounding influence on the outcome analysis.
In conclusion, the RVP has unveiled many viral pathogens
that have not been routinely detected or cultured in clinical settings. In comparison to patients with negative
detection for viral pathogens, those with positive detection
for viral pathogens had significantly lower rates of leukocytosis, evidence of bacterial infection, and shorter

duration of hospitalization. Multiple viral infections were
more common in younger children and did not predict a
worse outcome such as duration of fever and hospitalization. The most common identified virus remained HRV
whilst HBoV was present in a high percentage in multiple
viral infections. Moreover, LRTI was independently associated with multiple viral infections, RSV infection and longer
hospitalization duration. Further studies on the pathogenesis, disease severity and outcome of different viral combinations are needed to clarify the interplay of host and
viruses in multiple viral infections.
