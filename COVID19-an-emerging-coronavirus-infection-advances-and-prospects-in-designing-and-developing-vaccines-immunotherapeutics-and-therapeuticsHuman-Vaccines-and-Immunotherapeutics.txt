The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan,
Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop
vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades.
However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the
efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major
inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not
many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter
COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to
counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and
MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
viruses of the family Coronaviridae (subfamily Coronavirinae)
that infect a wide host range to produce diseases ranging from
common cold to severe/fatal illnesses. The novel virus was initially
named “2019-nCoV” which was changed to “SARS-CoV-2” by
the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), since it was found to be the
sister virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV).1 The ongoing coronavirus threat that emerged in
China has rapidly spread to other countries and has been declared
as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization
(WHO). Many nations are diverting their best efforts for the
implementation of appropriate preventive and control strategies.
Neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for
the treatment of human and animal coronavirus infections.2-4
Many efforts have been directed to develop vaccines against
human CoV infections in recent decades, but a limiting factor is
the degree of cross-protection rendered by these vaccines due to
their extensive sequence diversity.5 Various vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and drug options have been explored during the
recent threats of Zika, Ebola, and Nipah viruses6-8 as well as
against previous CoVs including SARS- and MERS-CoVs.3,5,9-12
These valuable options can be exploited for their potency, efficacy,
and safety along with expediting other ongoing research2,4,13-15

so as to discover valuable modalities for tackling the
emerging COVID-19, but as yet there is no effective vaccine or
therapeutic, for which intense efforts are ongoing.
Most of the therapeutic options that are available for
managing COVID-19 are based on previous experiences in
treating SARS- and MERS-CoV. A major reason for the lack
of approved and commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents against these CoVs might be the relative lack of
interest among the pharmaceutical companies.13 These are
outbreak scenarios: the demand for drugs or vaccines lasts
only for a period while the outbreak lasts. The number of
affected people will also be a small proportion of the global
drug and vaccine market. So by the time a new drug or
vaccine is developed, there might not be any patients for
clinical trials and also no meaningful market for newly discovered drugs. According to WHO guidelines, infected
patients will receive supportive care including oxygen therapy,
fluid therapy, and antibiotics for treating secondary bacterial
infections. The WHO also recommends the isolation of
patients suspected or confirmed for COVID-19.16 The major
therapeutic drugs that might be effective in managing
COVID-19 include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or
in combination with interferon-β, convalescent plasma, and
mAbs.17 Nevertheless, before utilizing these drugs for
COVID-19 pneumonia patients, clinical efficacy, and safety
studies should be conducted.

This article describes advances in designing vaccines and
therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also discussing
experiences with SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together
could pave ways in the right direction to halt this emerging
virus.
Multiple strategies are adopted in the development of CoV vaccines; most of these target the surface-exposed spike (S) glycoprotein or S protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies.
Several S-protein-based strategies have been attempted for developing CoV vaccines, e.g., use of full-length S protein or
S1-receptor-binding domain (RBD) and expression in virus-like
particles (VLP), DNA, or viral vectors5,9,18-21 The S protein molecule contains two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit has an RBD
that interacts with its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), whereas the S2 subunit mediates fusion
between the virus and host cell membranes for releasing viral
RNA into the cytoplasm for replication.19 Hence, S-proteinbased vaccines should induce antibodies that block not only viral
receptor binding but also virus genome uncoating. It has been
shown that the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of porcine
Deltacoronavirus constitutes the immunodominant region, and
the immune response to this region shows the most potent neutralizing effect.22 The S protein has a major role in the induction of
protective immunity during infection with SARS-CoV by eliciting
neutralizing-antibodies and T-cell responses.19 Thus, full-length
or appropriate parts of the S glycoprotein are believed to be the
most promising candidate CoV vaccine composition. It was also
reported that neither the absence nor presence of the other structural proteins affects S protein immunogenicity or its binding to
the ACE2 receptor that is a critical initial step for virus to access
into the host cell.23,24 Due to the superior ability of RBD to induce
neutralizing antibody, both recombinant proteins that contain
RBD and the recombinant vectors that encode RBD can be used
for developing the effective SARS-CoV vaccines.18
Recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine expressing MERSCoV S protein induces systemic IgG, secretory IgA, and lungresident memory T-cell responses when administered intranasally
into BALB/c mice and provide long-lasting neutralizing immunity
to MERS spike pseudotyped virus, thereby suggesting that the
vaccine may confer protection against MERS-CoV.24
Furthermore, rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector as well as Grampositive enhancer matrix (GEM) as a bacterial vector has been
used to express MERS-CoV S protein. The immune responses to
these vaccine candidates were evaluated in BALB/c mice for
cellular and humoral immune responses, which showed that RVbased vaccine stimulates significantly higher levels of cellular
immunity and earlier antibody responses in comparison to the
GEM particle vector.12
The possibility of developing a universal CoV vaccine was
assessed based on the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARSand MERS-CoV that confirmed the potential for crossreactivity among CoVs.25 SARS-CoV-2 shares high genetic
similarity with the SARS-CoV26 such that vaccines developed
for SARS-CoV may exhibit cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2.
The comparative evaluation performed on full-length
S protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV identified
that the most variable residues were located in the S1 subunit
of S protein, the critical CoV vaccine target.27 These findings
suggest that the specific neutralizing antibodies that are effective against the SARS-CoV might not be effective against the
SARS-CoV-2. Even though the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has
key mutations compared to the SARS-CoV, they will still act
as a viable target for vaccine development.28 Likewise, the
close similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-CoV suggests
that the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 might be the same as that
of SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2).29
Immuno-informatics approach can be used for the identification of epitopes for inclusion in COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Recently, immuno-informatics was used to identify
significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B-cell epitopes
in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The interactions between these
epitopes and their corresponding MHC class I molecules
were studied further by using molecular dynamics simulations
and found that the CTL epitopes bind with MHC class
I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, thus indicating their potential for generating immune responses.30 Such
epitopes may possess the ideal characteristics to become part
of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The nucleocapsid (N) protein as well as the potential B cell epitopes of the E protein of
MERS-CoV has been suggested as probable immunoprotective targets that induce both T-cell and neutralizing
antibody responses.31,32 Reverse genetic strategies have been
successfully used in live-attenuated vaccines to inactivate the
exonuclease effects of non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) or to
delete the envelope protein in SARS.5 Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a chicken CoV. It was suggested that
avian live virus IBV vaccine (strain H) might be useful for
SARS33 given that protection provided by strain H is based on
neutralizing antibody production as well as other immune
responses. Hence, avian IBV vaccine may be considered
another option for COVID-19 after evaluating its safety in
monkeys.34
Scientists of Rocky Mountain Laboratories are collaborating with Oxford University to develop a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate.35 The Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) recently
announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop
COVID-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine
platforms.36 Among the three programs, two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships. CEPI collaborated
with Inovio in 2018 to developing DNA vaccine candidates
for MERS ($56 M funding). The vaccine in development
utilizes DNA Medicines’ platform for delivering synthetic
genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins, which
elicit T-cell and antibody responses. CEPI has collaborated
with The University of Queensland in 2019 to develop the
molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral
pathogens including MERS-CoV ($10 M funding). The vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins
that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape.
This facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune
system.36 Other than these ongoing programs, CEPI has
announced funding to Moderna for comparing mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. They will design and manufacture an
mRNA vaccine in collaboration with the Vaccine Research
