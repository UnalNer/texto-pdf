Abstract
Background: Respiratory virome is an integral part of the human microbiome and its characterization may
contribute to a better understanding of the changes that arise in the disease and, consequently, influence the
approach and treatment of patients with acute lower respiratory infections.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals
undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, with and without acute lower respiratory infection (respectively WRI
and WORI groups).
Methods: We studied 44 mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples (collected with a double catheter, Combicath® kit)
from patients with mean age in the seventh decade, 20 from WORI group and 24 from WRI group, who were
hospitalized for acute respiratory failure in Intensive Care Units of two hospitals in the Lisbon area. Real-time PCR
was applied to verify analyse the presence of 15 common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, human bocavirus,
influenza virus A and B, repiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human enterovirus,
human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229E, NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1).
Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in six of the 20 patients in the WORI group: influenza AH3 (n = 2),
parainfluenza virus 1/3 (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) and human
metapneumovirus (n = 1).
In the WRI group, respiratory viruses were detected in 12 of the 24 patients: influenza AH3 (n = 3), human rhinovirus
(n = 3), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 3), human metapneumovirus (n = 3), human bocavirus (n = 2) and human
enterovirus (n = 1). Simultaneous detection of two viruses was recorded in two samples in both groups.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest the presence of common respiratory viruses in the lower respiratory
tract without causing symptomatic infection, even in carefully collected lower samples. This may have important
implications on the interpretation of the results on the diagnostic setting.

Background
The human microbiome was firstly defined by Joshua
Lederberg in 2001, as a community of microorganisms
that live in our organism, establishing a relationship of
commensalism, symbiosis or pathogenicity [1].

Due to several factors, the study of the human virome
has been neglected in comparison with the bacterial
microbiome, namely the heterogeneity of the viral genome that leads to the absence of universal molecular
markers, such as 16S ribosomal RNA for bacteria or fungal internal transcribed spacer region for fungi, the difficulty in working with small biomass samples, the
interference of genetic material from the host, inadequate bioinformatic instruments for its analysis and the
absence of robust databases [2, 3]. In the particular case
of lung virome, there is also the problem of the sample

collection, unlike with other mucosal surfaces which are
easily accessible.
Until recently, the lung was considered a sterile organ
[4], which was explained by the protective mechanisms
of the upper airways and the barrier function of the mucosa of the lower airways. The presence of bacteria in
the lower airways was interpreted as a pathological
phenomenon, based on cultural microbiological information [5]. It was explained as transient migration by
microaspiration, reflecting the composition of the upper
respiratory tract, although the biomass would be lower.
It was further conceded that the lower respiratory tract
microbiome could be related to contamination of the
upper tract during sampling [6]. According to Dickson
and Huffnagle, the notion that the lungs are sterile is
still frequently stated in textbooks, virtually always without citation [7]. Respiratory culture-based protocols
sought only to identify clinically significant pathogens
[8].
At the beginning of the current decade, studies based
on culture-independent methods have shown the presence of a small amount of bacterial communities in the
lungs of healthy, non-smoker individuals, with some diversity in their elements. There are few studies available
in the literature on the characterization of the respiratory tract virome, especially of the lower airways [9–14].
Essentialy, most of the studied population was in the
pediatric age and the majority of them had respiratory
infection. Most of the observations made on these studies were based on upper respiratory tract samples, like
nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal mucosa exudates, because of its greater accessibility, assuming that the results obtained could translate what was happening in the
lower airways.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals with and without acute lower respiratory
infection undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. In
order to achieve this, we evaluated the presence of the
most common respiratory viruses in the population [15],
in lower airway samples collected from individuals with
and without respiratory infection, undergoing mechanical ventilation, using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (respectively PCR and RT-PCR) techniques.

Methods
Study design

This was a prospective observational study analyzing
mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL) samples of
invasive mechanical ventilated patients from two polivalent Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of Lisbon district,
in Portugal. Patients were divided in two groups;
WORI group included patients admitted for causes

other than respiratory infection and not receiving
antibiotic therapy (respiratory symptoms were excluded at time of admission, namely cough and sputum; chest x-ray was performed in all the patients to
exclude lower respiratory infection. It was not possible to obtain reliable information about the presence
of respiratory symptoms before admission nor about
influenza vaccination history). WRI group included
patients admitted for acute respiratory infection and
on antibiotic therapy. All patients enrolled in the
study required endotracheal intubation to treat their
acute respiratory failure.
Exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years, pregnancy, immunosupression and antiviral therapy on admission. The participants, or their legal representatives,
were informed about the study objectives and their
signed consents were obtained previously to the sample
collection. The Ethic Committees of both participating
centers approved the study protocol.
Patient demographics, comorbidities, Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and
Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, admission
diagnosis and ICU clinical outcome were recorded.
Sample collection was performed with a Combicath®
kit, between December 2016 and March 2017.

Mini-BAL procedure

A protected mini-BAL (with a double catheter, Combicath® kit (Plastimed, Saint-Leu-La Forêt, France)) was
performed on the first 24 h after the tracheal intubation
and invasive mechanical ventilation. A combicath was
introduced blindly through the oro-tracheal tubeuntil its
end on the lower third of the trachea and wedged in the
bronchial tree. Mini-BAL samples were obtained by
intilling 2 mL of room temperature saline solution
(0.9%), followed by gentle suction after the infusion of
each aliquot. Samples were stored at − 80 °C until
processed.

Laboratory methods

Clinical samples were processed using the QIAmp
MinElute Virus Spin kit for extraction, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
“In house” real-time Taqman PCR and RT-PCR techniques, detailed elsewhere [16], were used for the detection of DNA and RNA respiratory viruses: adenovirus,
human bocavirus (HBoV), influenza virus A/B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus
(HPIV) types 1/3 and 2/4, human enterovirus (HEV),
human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus
(HMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV) group 1 (229E,
NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1).

Results

Viruses detected using real-time PCR

The viruses detected are depicted on Table 2. In the
WORI group, 6 of the 20 patients were positive and in
the WRI group 12 of the 24 patients were positive. The
Cycle Threshold (Ct) varied between 16.14 and 28.78 on
WORI group and between 14.52 and 36.86, on WRI
group.
In WORI group, the following viruses were identified:
Influenza AH3, HPIV 1/3, RSV, HMPV and HRV. In
two samples two viruses were detected simultaneously,
Influenza AH3 and HRV in one sample and HMPV and
HRV in the other one. Both patients died in the ICU. Influenza viruses AH3, HPIV 1/3 and HRV were present
in more than one sample.
In the WRI group were detected: Influenza AH3, RSV,
HMPV, HRV, HEV and HBoV. Influenza virus AH3,
RSV, HMPV and HRV were each identified in three

samples. HBoV was identified in two samples and HEV
in only one sample. There were three cases of association of two viruses, HEV and HRV, Influenza AH3 with
HMPV and HMPV with HBoV. There were six cases of
bacterial co-infection with Staphylococcus aureus (N =
2), Moraxella catarrhalis (N = 2) and Streptococcus
pneumoniae (N = 2), detected by the routine microbiological procedure in cases of lower respiratory infection.
None of these nine patients with viral or bacterial and
viral co-infection died in the ICU.
In WORI group, patients with positive samples
(WORI+) were older than patients with negative samples
(WORI-) (74.2 vs. 61.6 years). Also, WORI+ patients had
higher mean severity scores (APACHE II 25.3 vs. 21.9,
SAPS II 59.8 vs. 54.8), lower ICU length of stay (4.8 vs.
12.1 days) and invasive mechanical ventilation days (2.3
vs. 9.5) and higher mortality rate (66.7% vs. 42.9%),
(Table 3).
Concerning to WRI group, the mean age was the same
(70.7 years) in both subgroups of patients, WRI+ and

41.7%).
The subgroup WORI+ had higher median age (74.2 vs.

the WORI+ subgroup than in the WRI+ subgroup
(66.7% vs. 16.7%).

Discussion
In our study it was possible to identify common respiratory viruses in samples of the lower respiratory tract of
adults under invasive mechanical ventilation, regardless
of the presence or absence of acute lower respiratory infection, through real-time PCR techniques. In the field
of pulmonary virology investigation, several factors make
this study innovative: the age and type of patients, the
inclusion of two groups of patients, with (WRI group)
and without acute lower respiratory infection (WORI
group), and also the type of samples (protected samples
from the distal lower respiratory tract). According to
Luyt et al, BAL is the respiratory sample of choice to
evaluate lung infection [17].
Nucleic acid extraction was performed with the same
commercial kit used in the study of Wang et al [13],
who analized the respiratory virome of healthy and severe acute respiratory infection children through metagenomic analysis. We used “in-house” real-time PCR
and RT-PCR techniques that were tested and validated
long before [16].
Thirty percent of the patients belonging to WORI
group had common respiratory viruses in the distal
lower respiratory tract. According to data from the
pediatric population [13], lung virome of asymptomatic
individuals is less diverse than that of infected individuals,

and consists mostly, of members of the Anelloviridae family, with a lower percentage of common epidemic respiratory viruses. In the study of Wang et al [13], samples from
infected patients had six to seven-fold more viral pathogens than the WRI group. These authors suggested that
the viral infection may be asymptomatic and, occasionally
prolonged, making controversial the interpretation of a
positive PCR for some viruses.
. In a study conducted by Choi et al [18], the main respiratory viruses associated with severe pneumonia in
adults admitted in ICU were HRV (23.6%), HPIV
(20.8%), HMPV (18.1%), influenza (16.7%) and RSV
(13.9%), according to data obtained from real-time PCR
analysis in bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In the study
by Xu et al [14], 368 samples collected with nasopharyngeal swab from infected children were analyzed with
real-time PCR, using a panel of 18 respiratory viruses.
The percentage of positive samples was 58.97%.
In our study, half of the WRI group patients had positive samples. Comparing the two groups, influenza AH3
was the most prevalent virus, coinciding with the peak
of influenza in Portugal. RSV, HMPV and HRV were
common to both groups. Differences were found with
HPIV 1/3, which was more prevalent in uninfected patients, and HEV and HBoV that were, only found in
WRI group. The analysis of the Ct values showed similar
viral loads in both groups, although with a slightly tendency for lower Ct values in WORI group. The small
number of samples did not allow us to draw conclusions
about possible differences in viral loads between infected
and uninfected individuals.
It may be hypothesized that some respiratory viruses, such as influenza, RSV, HMPV and HRV, may
transiently colonize the mucosa of the tracheobronchial tract at times of increased viral activity, whereas
others, such as HPIV 1/3, might be prolonged colonizers. However, only a longitudinal study could determine the extent of the colonization period and
thus solve this important issue. In addition, we need
to know the meaning of its presence, if they are only
bystanders, even during an acute respiratory infection,

Nazareth et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine

(2020) 20:39

or if they are responsible for symptomatic infections
of the lower respiratory tract.
Our study has some limitations, including a small sample size and a limited number of centers involved, which
does not allow us to make inferences about mortality between the groups and subgroups. In addition, all the patients in both groups were severely ill. Therefore, the
observations made in this study may not be generalizable
to other groups, in particular to healthy populations.
Although signs and symptoms of respiratory infection
were excluded at admission in the WORI group, viral respiratory infections in the last weeks preceding
hospitalization cannot be excluded, and therefore viral
detection in some of the cases could be the result of a
recent infection and not an extended stay in the lower
respiratory tract.
In this study a protected mini-BAL (with a double
catheter, Combicath® kit) was used in order to reduce
the upper level contamination. However, it is possible
that contamination from upper respiratory secretions,
mainly due to the ventilation process, may have had an
important contribution to the detection rate observed in
this study.
Another limitation relates with the methodology used:
although real-time PCR is currently the gold-standard
for the diagnosis of viral infections [19], this methodology is limited to specific target sequences. In fact, only
the most common respiratory viruses were investigated.
According to Willner et al [9], PCR-based studies confer
an incomplete airway virome picture and little opportunity for the discovery of new agents, as compared to
metagenomics, a technique independent of genomic sequences. In addition, viruses like herpesvirus simplex,
cytomegalovirus or torque teno virus can be present in
the distal airway mucosa [13, 20–22], and therefore may
have been missed with our PCR strategy. However, despite this limitation, the main respiratory viruses were
properly searched, and this is the group of major concern, when dealing with respiratory infections. Another
important advantage of this study was the focus on a
population undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation,
allowing the collection of samples from the distal airways, although blindly, which is usually a limitation in
this type of studies.

Conclusions
The results of this study suggest the presence of common respiratory viruses in the lower respiratory tract
without determining symptomatic infection even in carefully collected lower samples. This may have important
implications on the interpretation of the results on the
diagnostic setting.
The accomplishment of a longitudinal study would
allow to elucidate the length of stay of these viruses in

the respiratory tract, and the existence or not of a permanent viral community in this environment.
