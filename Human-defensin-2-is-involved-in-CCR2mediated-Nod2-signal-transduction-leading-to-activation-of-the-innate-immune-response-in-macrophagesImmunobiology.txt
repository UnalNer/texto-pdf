Beta-defensins contribute to host innate defense against various pathogens, including viruses, although the
details of their roles in innate immune cells are unclear. We previously reported that human β-defensin 2 (HBD
2) activates primary innate immunity against viral infection and suggested that it plays a role in the induction of
the adaptive immune response. We analyzed the mechanisms by which HBD 2 primes innate antiviral immunity
and polarized activation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein (S RBD) as a model antigen. The expression of
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2), type I interferons, (IFNs), and proinﬂammatory
mediators was enhanced in S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells. S RBD-HBD 2 treatment also enhanced phosphorylation and activation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 and IFN regulatory factor 3
compared to S RBD alone. Finally, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD interacted with C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2),
and Nod2 was involved in HBD 2-mediated CCR2 signaling, which was associated with the activation and M1
polarization of THP-1 cells. Therefore, HBD 2 promotes CCR2-mediated Nod2 signaling, which induces production of type I IFNs and an inﬂammatory response, and enhances primary innate immunity leading to an
eﬀective adaptive immune response to HBD 2-conjugated antigen.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a component of the primary host
defense in the mucosa. AMPs are produced mainly by epithelial cells
and the cells involved in innate immunity. The functions of AMPs in
defense against various infections are better characterized than their
role as innate immune modulators (Boyton and Openshaw, 2002). Defensins are small cationic AMPs and are found in various organisms
including mammals, insects, and plants. Among them, β-defensins are
primarily produced by epithelial cells and leukocytes in vertebrates
(Stolzenberg et al., 1997). Immature dendritic cells (DCs) can be activated by β-defensins, and β-defensins also inhibit infection by Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and viruses (Zhao et al., 2016; Laﬀerty et al., 2017).
Inactivation of human β-defensins (HBDs) leads to the recurrent airway
infections experienced by patients with cystic ﬁbrosis (Smith et al.,
1996). Also, a lack of human β-defensin 2 (HBD 2) results in immune
dysfunction, such as reduced numbers of B and regulatory T cells, resulting in decreased production of antigen (Ag)-speciﬁc
immunoglobulin A (Lugering et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2007).
Therefore, an understanding of the regulatory mechanism by which
AMPs modulate the immune response during the early stage of viral
infection is critically needed to deal with various diseases caused by
virus infection.
Virus infection of host cells triggers innate antiviral responses,
which are initiated via pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling
pathways (Ishii et al., 2008). Among the PRR families, nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2) is an important
mediator of the innate immune response to viral infection, and induces
expression of type I interferons (IFNs) to promote the expression of
proinﬂammatory cytokines and restrict viral replication (Wiese et al.,
2017). Furthermore, Nod2-deﬁcient mice exhibit decreased production
of IFNs and increased susceptibility to viral infection (Sabbah et al.,
2009). Presumably, the ability of a virus to counteract innate antiviral
immunity during the early stage of infection inﬂuences pathogenicity
and disease severity (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005). Type I IFNs play a
major role in the antiviral innate immune response by upregulating the
Escherichia coli expression vector (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). Recombinant proteins with an N-terminal His tag were puriﬁed using NiNTA Superﬂow (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
production of antiviral proteins and the recruitment of immune cells
(Haller et al., 2006). Production of type I IFN is initiated by ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic viral sensors in response to detection of
viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded
RNA (Kato et al., 2011; Li and Zhong, 2018). Stimulated viral sensors
activate downstream signaling pathways, leading to expression of
transcription factors including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which drive IFN-β expression (Yoneyama et al.,
2004). However, some viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), inhibit these type I IFN induction
pathways (Zielecki et al., 2013). For example, various proteins of
MERS-CoV, including M protein, papain-like protease protein (PLpro),
and accessory proteins 4a and 4b, are antagonists of IFNs (Shokri et al.,
2019). Accordingly, the virulence of MERS-CoV is linked to its immune
evasion mechanisms, such as suppression of IFN production during the
early stage of infection, induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inactivation of T cells with downregulation of Ag presentation (Niemeyer
et al., 2013).
Macrophages are professional phagocytes capable of internalizing
and degrading pathogens and apoptotic cells. Macrophages are present
in the respiratory mucosa, such as in the lung and various ﬂuid compartments, where the detection of and the response to infection occur.
Due to their location, macrophages detect viral Ags ﬁrst and promote an
antiviral innate immune response as well as an Ag-speciﬁc adaptive
immune response by presenting Ags to T-cells (Manicassamy et al.,
2010). We previously reported that HBD 2 promotes an antiviral innate
immune response in macrophage-like THP-1 cells and elicits an enhanced Ag-speciﬁc and virus-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in
vivo using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike
protein (S RBD) as a model Ag (Kim et al., 2018). Moreover, the type I
IFN response and the production of primary antiviral molecules such as
Nod2 were enhanced by S RBD-HDB 2 treatment of THP-1 cells (Kim
et al., 2018). Consequently, we assumed that modulation of Nod2 signaling by HBD 2 would prevent infection by viruses that suppress innate antiviral immunity. In this study, we investigated the mechanism
by which HBD 2 enhances the type I IFN immune response in THP-1
cells by modulating Nod2 signaling pathways using HBD 2-conjugated S
RBD of MERS-CoV.
THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Welgene, Gyeongsan,
Korea) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island,
NY, USA) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The cells were treated with
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (1 μg/mL for 1 × 106 cells) for 2–3
days to induce diﬀerentiation into macrophages (Daigneault et al.,
2010). The cultures were replenished with fresh medium, maintained
for 3 days, and incubated with recombinant S RBD or S BRD-HBD 2
(1 μg/mL per 1 × 106 cells) with or without inhibitors (RS 102,895 for
CCR2 and GSK 717 for Nod2). The cells were harvested after 6 or 24 h
and subjected to quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or western blotting.
2.4. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Thermo-Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
was used to synthesize cDNA with an MMLV Reverse Transcription Kit
(Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Gene expression levels were measured
by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and an ABI 7500 system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using 50 ng of ﬁrst-strand cDNA
under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles at
95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The expression levels
were normalized to that of β-actin (hACTB) using 7500 FAST software
version 2.0.6 (Applied Biosystems). The primer sets used to amplify
target genes are listed in Table 1.
