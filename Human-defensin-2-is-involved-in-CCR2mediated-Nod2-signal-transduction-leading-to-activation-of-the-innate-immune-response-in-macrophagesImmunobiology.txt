Beta-defensins contribute to host innate defense against various pathogens, including viruses, although the
details of their roles in innate immune cells are unclear. We previously reported that human β-defensin 2 (HBD
2) activates primary innate immunity against viral infection and suggested that it plays a role in the induction of
the adaptive immune response. We analyzed the mechanisms by which HBD 2 primes innate antiviral immunity
and polarized activation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein (S RBD) as a model antigen. The expression of
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2), type I interferons, (IFNs), and proinﬂammatory
mediators was enhanced in S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells. S RBD-HBD 2 treatment also enhanced phosphorylation and activation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 and IFN regulatory factor 3
compared to S RBD alone. Finally, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD interacted with C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2),
and Nod2 was involved in HBD 2-mediated CCR2 signaling, which was associated with the activation and M1
polarization of THP-1 cells. Therefore, HBD 2 promotes CCR2-mediated Nod2 signaling, which induces production of type I IFNs and an inﬂammatory response, and enhances primary innate immunity leading to an
eﬀective adaptive immune response to HBD 2-conjugated antigen.

1. Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a component of the primary host
defense in the mucosa. AMPs are produced mainly by epithelial cells
and the cells involved in innate immunity. The functions of AMPs in
defense against various infections are better characterized than their
role as innate immune modulators (Boyton and Openshaw, 2002). Defensins are small cationic AMPs and are found in various organisms
including mammals, insects, and plants. Among them, β-defensins are
primarily produced by epithelial cells and leukocytes in vertebrates
(Stolzenberg et al., 1997). Immature dendritic cells (DCs) can be activated by β-defensins, and β-defensins also inhibit infection by Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and viruses (Zhao et al., 2016; Laﬀerty et al., 2017).
Inactivation of human β-defensins (HBDs) leads to the recurrent airway
infections experienced by patients with cystic ﬁbrosis (Smith et al.,
1996). Also, a lack of human β-defensin 2 (HBD 2) results in immune
dysfunction, such as reduced numbers of B and regulatory T cells, resulting in decreased production of antigen (Ag)-speciﬁc

immunoglobulin A (Lugering et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2007).
Therefore, an understanding of the regulatory mechanism by which
AMPs modulate the immune response during the early stage of viral
infection is critically needed to deal with various diseases caused by
virus infection.
Virus infection of host cells triggers innate antiviral responses,
which are initiated via pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling
pathways (Ishii et al., 2008). Among the PRR families, nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2) is an important
mediator of the innate immune response to viral infection, and induces
expression of type I interferons (IFNs) to promote the expression of
proinﬂammatory cytokines and restrict viral replication (Wiese et al.,
2017). Furthermore, Nod2-deﬁcient mice exhibit decreased production
of IFNs and increased susceptibility to viral infection (Sabbah et al.,
2009). Presumably, the ability of a virus to counteract innate antiviral
immunity during the early stage of infection inﬂuences pathogenicity
and disease severity (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005). Type I IFNs play a
major role in the antiviral innate immune response by upregulating the

production of antiviral proteins and the recruitment of immune cells
(Haller et al., 2006). Production of type I IFN is initiated by ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic viral sensors in response to detection of
viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded
RNA (Kato et al., 2011; Li and Zhong, 2018). Stimulated viral sensors
activate downstream signaling pathways, leading to expression of
transcription factors including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which drive IFN-β expression (Yoneyama et al.,
2004). However, some viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), inhibit these type I IFN induction
pathways (Zielecki et al., 2013). For example, various proteins of
MERS-CoV, including M protein, papain-like protease protein (PLpro),
and accessory proteins 4a and 4b, are antagonists of IFNs (Shokri et al.,
2019). Accordingly, the virulence of MERS-CoV is linked to its immune
evasion mechanisms, such as suppression of IFN production during the
early stage of infection, induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inactivation of T cells with downregulation of Ag presentation (Niemeyer
et al., 2013).
Macrophages are professional phagocytes capable of internalizing
and degrading pathogens and apoptotic cells. Macrophages are present
in the respiratory mucosa, such as in the lung and various ﬂuid compartments, where the detection of and the response to infection occur.
Due to their location, macrophages detect viral Ags ﬁrst and promote an
antiviral innate immune response as well as an Ag-speciﬁc adaptive
immune response by presenting Ags to T-cells (Manicassamy et al.,
2010). We previously reported that HBD 2 promotes an antiviral innate
immune response in macrophage-like THP-1 cells and elicits an enhanced Ag-speciﬁc and virus-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in
vivo using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike
protein (S RBD) as a model Ag (Kim et al., 2018). Moreover, the type I
IFN response and the production of primary antiviral molecules such as
Nod2 were enhanced by S RBD-HDB 2 treatment of THP-1 cells (Kim
et al., 2018). Consequently, we assumed that modulation of Nod2 signaling by HBD 2 would prevent infection by viruses that suppress innate antiviral immunity. In this study, we investigated the mechanism
by which HBD 2 enhances the type I IFN immune response in THP-1
cells by modulating Nod2 signaling pathways using HBD 2-conjugated S
RBD of MERS-CoV.

2.3. Cell culture
THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Welgene, Gyeongsan,
Korea) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island,
NY, USA) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The cells were treated with
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (1 μg/mL for 1 × 106 cells) for 2–3
days to induce diﬀerentiation into macrophages (Daigneault et al.,
2010). The cultures were replenished with fresh medium, maintained
for 3 days, and incubated with recombinant S RBD or S BRD-HBD 2
(1 μg/mL per 1 × 106 cells) with or without inhibitors (RS 102,895 for
CCR2 and GSK 717 for Nod2). The cells were harvested after 6 or 24 h
and subjected to quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or western blotting.
2.4. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Thermo-Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
was used to synthesize cDNA with an MMLV Reverse Transcription Kit
(Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Gene expression levels were measured
by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and an ABI 7500 system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using 50 ng of ﬁrst-strand cDNA
under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles at
95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The expression levels
were normalized to that of β-actin (hACTB) using 7500 FAST software
version 2.0.6 (Applied Biosystems). The primer sets used to amplify
target genes are listed in Table 1.
2.5. Protein preparation and western blotting
Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS),
and lysed in a lysis buﬀer containing 1% Triton X-100 supplemented

Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MERS-CoV (1-001-MER-IS-2015001)
was provided by the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(KCDC). All experiments using MERS-CoV were performed in accordance with the World Health Organization recommendations in a
biosafety level 3 facility in the Korea Zoonosis Research Institute at
Chonbuk National University (Iksan, Korea). The chemicals and laboratory wares were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
USA) and SPL Life Sciences (Pocheon, Korea), respectively, unless

Production of recombinant MERS-CoV S RBD with or without HBD 2
at the C-terminus (residues 291–725) of the S1 domain were performed
as described previously with minor modiﬁcations (Ma et al., 2014).
Brieﬂy, the gene encoding S RBD was synthesized with codon optimization based on the MERS-CoV S protein sequence (GenBank
AKL59401.1; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The S RBD gene with
the HBD 2 gene at its 3′ terminus was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using forward and reverse primers reported previously
(Kim et al., 2018). The ampliﬁed genes were cloned into the pColdII

(Fig. 2). S RBD-HBD 2 signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the expression
of IFN-β and Nod2 by 2.18- and 7.35-fold, respectively, compared to S
RBD alone-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 2A and B). The expression of TNFα, an NF-κB-dependent proinﬂammatory cytokine, was increased in S
RBD-HBD 2-treated cells compared with that in S RBD alone-treated
cells, albeit not signiﬁcantly so (Fig. 2C). We next assessed the levels of
the Nod2-associated signal transducing mediators, receptor interacting
protein-2 (RIP2) and IRF3, in S RBD- or S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1
cells (Fig. 3). As expected, treatment with S RBD-HBD 2 remarkably
upregulated the phosphorylation of RIP2 and IRF3 and the Nod2 protein level. In addition, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD reduced IκBα accumulation, degradation of which requires NF-κB activation (Fig. 3C).
Therefore, HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment induces the production of
the type I IFN, IFN-β, and the proinﬂammatory cytokine, TNF-α,
through Nod2-associated RIP2 response by activating the transcription
factors IRF3 and NF-κB.

with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Total cell lysates were
prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Equal amounts of
lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA,
USA), and immunoblotted using speciﬁc Abs. Primary Abs against
human p-RIP2 and p-IRF3 were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA,
USA) and Abs against Nod2 and IκBα were from Invitrogen (Grand
Island, NY, USA) and Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA), respectively.
The primary Ab against human β-actin was purchased from Bioss
(Woburn, MA, USA). Target proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo-Fisher Scientiﬁc).
2.6. Viral infection
MERS-CoV was propagated in Vero E6 cells, which were cultured in
DMEM medium (Welgene) containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. To assess the viral loads and the expression levels of target
genes in MERS-CoV-infected cells, MERS-CoV was passaged six times in
Vero E6 cells and transferred to THP-1 cells (2 × 106/well) in a tissue
culture plate. After incubation for 24 h, we extracted total RNA and
performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR using the primers in Table 1
to measure the expression levels of MERS-CoV upE and target genes
(Kim et al., 2018).

3.2. HBD 2-conjugated Ag-mediated induction of a type I IFN response was
mediated by CCR2 signaling
β-Defensin-fused proteins retain their antibacterial and chemotactic
activity for C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6)-expressing cells, as do
monocytes that do not express CCR6 (Röhrl et al., 2010a). In addition,
the β-defensin-conjugated proteins induced CCR2-speciﬁc chemotaxis
on CCR2-transfected HEK293 cells, human peripheral blood monocytes,
and mouse peritoneal exudate cells in a dose-dependent manner (Röhrl
et al., 2010b). Therefore, we determined whether HBD 2 binds to CCR2
rather than CCR6 (Fig. 4) by immunoﬂuorescence assay in THP-1 cells
(Fig. 4A). CCR2 and S RBD-HBD 2 co-localized, suggesting a direct
interaction, but no such co-localization with CCR2 was observed for S
RBD alone (data not shown). We next evaluated whether the interaction
of HBD 2 with CCR2 mediates intracellular signaling. Interestingly, the
signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) enhanced IFN-β expression by S RBD-HBD 2
was abrogated by the CCR2 antagonist, RS 102,895 (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
the Nod2 expression and Nod2-associated RIP2 and IRF3 expression
enhanced signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) by S RBD-HBD 2 was abrogated by
the CCR2 antagonist (Fig. 4C–E), as was TNF-α, whose expression is
dependent on NF-κB activation (Fig. 4F). Thus, HBD 2 interacts directly
with CCR2, which promotes signal transduction, activation of type I
IFN, and an inﬂammatory response.

2.7. Immunoﬂuorescence assay
THP-1 cell monolayers in confocal dishes were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized using buﬀer containing
Triton X-100 (0.1%), blocked, and incubated with the recombinant
protein and a speciﬁc primary Ab. Primary Abs against human C-C
chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and Nod2 were purchased from
Invitrogen. A Penta-His Ab conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (Qiagen)
and anti-rabbit and -mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 or 568
(Invitrogen), respectively, were used as the secondary Abs. Finally,
washed cells were stained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),
covered with SlowFade Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen), and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, LSM 510,
Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).
2.8. Statistical analysis

3.3. Nod2 is involved in HBD 2-mediated intracellular signaling
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad, San
Diego, CA, USA). Data are means ± standard deviations (SDs). The
signiﬁcance of diﬀerences was assessed by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), and p < 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical signiﬁcance.

We next focused on endosomal and/or cytoplasmic signal transmediators involved in HBD 2-mediated activation of primary antiviral
responses. In our previous report, a proinﬂammatory cytokine response,
which requires the activation of NF-κB, was induced by HBD 2 (Kim
et al., 2018). Additionally, early stimulation of an innate immune response is dependent on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and/or Nod2-triggered NF-κB signaling (Tsai et al., 2011). We thus determined whether
the HBD 2-mediated enhancement is due to Nod2-associated signaling
because Nod2 expression was enhanced by S RBD-HBD 2 (Fig. 5). S
RBD-HBD 2 co-localized with Nod2, suggesting an interaction (Fig. 5A),
but no such co-localization with Nod2 occurred for S RBD without HBD
2 conjugation (data not shown). Consequently, we speculated that
Nod2 interacts with S RBD-HBD 2 and that Nod2-mediated signaling is
involved in HBD 2-mediated activation of NF-κB. We evaluated the
inﬂuence of Nod2 signaling on HBD 2-mediated type I IFN and proinﬂammatory responses using the inhibitor of Nod2 signaling, GSK 717.
GSK 717 abrogated the HBD 2-mediated (p < 0.01) enhanced expression of IFN-β, RIP2, and IRF3 (Fig. 5B–D). Additionally, a Nod2 inhibitor abrogated the enhanced expression of TNF-α in HBD 2-treated
THP-1 cells (Fig. 5E). These observations suggest that Nod2 functions as
an intracellular signal transmediator in HBD 2-induced activation of
type I IFN production and the inﬂammatory response.

3. Results
3.1. HBD 2-conjugated Ag stimulates the Nod2 signaling procedure, which
leads to type I IFN production in macrophage-like THP-1 cells
MERS-CoV infection inhibits the production of IFN-α/β and the host
antiviral immune response (Zielecki et al., 2013). We evaluated the
inﬂuence of MERS-CoV infection of THP-1 cells on the innate immune
response (Fig. 1). The expression level of the upE gene was assessed by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR at 24 h post-infection of THP-1 cells with
103, 104, and 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MERS-CoV (Fig. 1A).
Importantly, MERS-CoV infection dose-dependently decreased the expression of factors critical in antiviral innate immunity, such as Nod2,
IFN-α, and IFN-β (Fig. 1B–D).
To analyze whether HBD 2 aﬀects immune induction, we determined the expression levels of the IFN-β, Nod2, and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α genes in THP-1 cells treated with S RBD or S RBD-HBD 2

4. Discussion

3.4. CCR2- and Nod2-mediated signaling activated by HBD 2 induces
diﬀerentiation and polarization of THP-1 macrophage-like cells

Innate immunity is the ﬁrst line of defense against exogenous and
endogenous threats, including pathogen infection and tissue damage.
Innate immunity not only precedes the Ag-speciﬁc adaptive immune
response but also enables a long-lasting memory response by innate Agpresenting cells (APCs), which interact with adaptive immune cells.
Innate immune cells, such as macrophages and mast cells, recruited into
infected sites produce a wide range of cytokines that regulate the balance between pro- and anti-inﬂammatory responses and so maintain
immunological homeostasis (Gallenga et al., 2019). Cytokines have
pleiotropic eﬀects on the functions of immune cells and immune responses that constitute the host defense against infectious agents. For
instance, members of the IL-1 family, which are produced by macrophages and mast cells, are important regulators of the innate immune
response and play a role in inﬂammatory processes (Varvara et al.,
2018). Several IL-1 family cytokines are pro-inﬂammatory, while
others, including IL-37, IL-38, IL-1Ra, and IL-36Ra, are anti-inﬂammatory (Kritas et al., 2018). In addition, IL-1 indirectly participates
in T-lymphocyte-mediated immunity by inducing helper type 2 T-cell
polarization and the formation of Abs by plasma cells by producing IL-6
(Gallenga et al., 2019). These ﬁndings suggest that further studies on
modulation of the balance between pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines and network among innate immune cells, such as M1/M2 macrophage polarization, would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches for immunological disorders.
Macrophages, DCs, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and innate
lymphoid cells play major roles in pathogen recognition through specialized receptors such as PRRs (Akira et al., 2006; Shim and Lee, 2015;
Seo et al., 2013). Viral infection activates danger signals which are
transmitted via PRRs, including TLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like
receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors, cytosolic DNA sensors, and
inﬂammasome signaling cascades. Cross-talk between PRRs and

Macrophages can diﬀerentiate into M1 (classically activated) or M2
(alternatively activated) macrophages. Classical M1-type macrophages
are key eﬀector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virus-infected
cells, and malignant cells, while M2-type macrophages exhibit anti-inﬂammatory and tissue repair activities (Gordon and Martinez, 2010).
NF-κB signaling is an intracellular proinﬂammatory pathway (Hoesel
and Schmid, 2013) and activates M1-type macrophage diﬀerentiation
(Saijo and Glass, 2011). Consequently, we analyzed the expression of
marker genes of M1 and M2 macrophages in S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP1 cells by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 6). The expression of
CD16 and CD80 was signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) enhanced by the HBD 2conjugate, suggesting diﬀerentiation into M1-type macrophage cells. By
contrast, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the expression of M2
marker genes (CD163 and CD206) between cells treated with S RBD
and S RBD-HBD 2 (data not shown).
To identify the signaling pathways involved in HBD 2-mediated
activation and polarization of macrophages, we evaluated the eﬀect of a
CCR2 inhibitor, RS 102,895, and Nod2 inhibitor, GSK 717, on cells
treated with S RBD with or without HBD 2 conjugation. Expression of
the M1-type macrophage marker genes, CD16 and CD86, was markedly
downregulated by the CCR2 and Nod2 inhibitors compared to the
control (Fig. 6A and B). Interestingly, expression of CD14, a marker of
early activation of macrophages, was stably upregulated in both S RBD
alone- and S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells, while CD14 expression
was markedly downregulated by pretreatment with a CCR2 or Nod2
inhibitor, although the CCR2 inhibitor did not completely reverse the
HBD 2-mediated enhanced expression of CD14 (Fig. 6C). These results
demonstrate that CCR2-mediated activation of Nod2 signaling pathway
by S RBD-HBD 2 is associated with the activation and M1 polarization
of macrophage-like THP-1 cells.

and their encoding genes are regulated by several transcription factors,
including NF-κB and IRF3 (Seth et al., 2005). Upon virus infection, IRF3
is phosphorylated, dimerizes, and enters the nucleus to upregulate the
expression of type I IFN, melanoma diﬀerentiation-associated protein 5
(MDA5), and cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), leading
to activation of NF-κB and IRF3 (Kato et al., 2011).
The hosts react to infection by mounting a primary response involving inﬂammation, followed by a pathogen-speciﬁc adaptive response. Although inﬂammation is a double-edged response, it is an
important mechanism of protective innate immunity against infection
by viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, and parasites. Inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages and innate immune cells are rapidly recruited to inﬂamed sites, where they remove harmful stimuli and induce T-cell responses by IFN-dependent mechanisms (Ginhoux et al.,
2016). We previously reported that HBD 2 promotes the antiviral innate
immune response in THP-1 cells and the ability of an HBD 2-conjugated

activation of these signaling cascades induces an antiviral immune response by upregulating the expression of antiviral cytokines, including
type I IFNs. However, viruses can evade the antiviral function of IFN by
inhibiting IFN production and signal transduction (Ferran and Skuse,
2017). Type I IFNs, mainly IFN-α and IFN-β, are major eﬀector cytokines in the innate antiviral response (González-Navajas et al., 2012)

β-Defensins exert regulatory activity in host innate and adaptive
immune responses. For example, mouse β-defensin 2 activates immature DCs via TLR4, triggering a Th1 response, and human β-defensin
3 activates APCs via TLR1 and TLR2 in an NF-κB-dependent manner
(Funderburg et al., 2007). Additionally, it was suggested that β-defensin is an endogenous ligand for TLR4 and shares a signal transduction pathway with other TLR4 ligands. We evaluated the possible interaction between HBD 2 and TLR4 as well as Nod2 and found that HBD
2-conjugated Ag co-localized with Nod2 (Fig. 5A) but not with TLR4
(data not shown). Moreover, inhibition of Nod2 signaling in THP-1 cells
abrogated the HBD 2-mediated enhanced IFN-β expression by suppressing RIP2 and IRF3 signaling as well as TNF-α expression
(Fig. 5B–E). Human and mouse β-defensins induce CCR2- and CCR6dependent chemotaxis (Röhrl et al., 2010b) and CCR2 and CCR6 recruit

MERS-CoV Ag to elicit a greater Ag-speciﬁc and MERS-CoV neutralizing
Ab response compared to HBD 2 non-conjugated Ag in vivo (Kim et al.,
2018). Also, immunization with S RBD-HBD 2 prior to viral infection
enhanced the humoral and protective immune response to MERS-CoV
infection in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-expressing mice, a
model of MERS-CoV infection (data not shown). In addition, the type I
IFN response, the expression of primary antiviral molecules including
Nod2, a cytoplasmic viral PRR that activates IRF3, and production of
IFN-β were enhanced by HBD 2 treatment of THP-1 cells. These cells are
widely used as an in vitro model for studies of human macrophages
involved in the inﬂammatory response and immunological homeostasis
(Ginhoux et al., 2016). Here, we investigated the immunomodulatory
ability of HBD 2 and the mechanism by which HBD 2 induces production of type I IFN and an inﬂammatory response in THP-1 cells.

tissue repair and wound healing, produce IL-10 and TGF-β, and express
arginase-1 and CD163 (Gordon and Martinez, 2010). We report here
that HBD 2 induces the expression of M1 markers by activating CCR2mediated Nod2 signaling pathway in THP-1 cells (Fig. 6). Although
further studies are needed, these results provide insight into the mechanism by which HBD 2 induces antiviral innate and Ag-speciﬁc
adaptive immune responses.

professional APCs to inﬂamed tissues and initiate an adaptive immune
response (Osterholzer et al., 2005). CCR2 is expressed on various types
of myeloid cells, including monocytes and neutrophils, which are crucial for innate immunity and phagocytosis (Iida et al., 2005). We found
that HBD 2-conjugated Ag co-localized with CCR2 and contributed to
Nod2-mediated signaling, leading to the activation of type I IFN production and an inﬂammatory response in THP-1 cells. Consequently,
the mechanism underlying HBD 2-induced CCR2-mediated signaling
should be investigated further.
Macrophages help clear infectious cells by internalizing and degrading pathogens. During infection with inﬂuenza A, the phagocytic
capacity of mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages is enhanced by coculture with virus-infected epithelial cells (Fujimoto et al., 2000), and
decreased phagocytic uptake of opsonized inﬂuenza A virus is correlated with decreased cell surface expression of CD16 and CD32, which
are highly expressed by classically activated M1 macrophages. Also,
expression of CD16 and CD32 is decreased in macrophages infected
with viruses capable of replicating productively in them (Marvin et al.,
2017). M1 macrophages exert a proinﬂammatory eﬀect, present Ag,
perform phagocytosis, produce TNF-α and IL-1β, and express CD80 and
CD86 on their surface. By contrast, M2 macrophages are responsible for
