Abstract
Objective This study aims to evaluate the correlation between viral clearance and blood biochemical index of 94 discharged
patients with COVID-19 infection in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, enrolled from Jan 5 to Feb 13, 2020.
Methods The clinical and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients. The data
were analysed and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information on clinical signs and symptoms, medical treatment,
virus clearance, and laboratory parameters including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein were collected.
Results COVID-19 mRNA clearance ratio was identified significantly correlated with the decline of serum creatine kinase
(CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Furthermore, COVID-19 mRNA clearance time was positively correlated with
the length of hospital stay in patients treated with either IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir or IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin.
Conclusions Therapeutic regimens of IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19. Serum LDH or CK decline may predict a favorable response to treatment of COVID-19
infection.

Introduction
Since Dec 8, 2019, the sudden outbreak of a mysterious
pneumonia cases, infected with a novel coronavirus known
as COVID-19, have rapidly spread from Wuhan [1] to other
areas, causing staggering number of infections and deaths.
As of this writing, a total of 77,272 cases including 2597
deaths have been reported in China. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, COVID-19 belongs to a distinct clade of
beta-coronavirus similar to human severe acute respiratory

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two species
outbreaking in the latest decade and causing severe human
deaths [2]. Despite the estimated fatality rate of COVID19 is lower than that of SARS or MERS, the scale of the
COVID-19 contagion has caused more casualties than either
of them as of this writing [3]. In addition, human to human
transmission of COVID-19 has been confirmed [4]. A number of cases of COVID-19 infection has been reported by
investigators who described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients [5–8]. However,
there is a limited number of detailed analysis on cytokines,
blood chemicals or viral mRNA clearance rate on discharged
patients.
Here, we aim to describe the changes and correlation of
clinical features and candidate molecular markers, as well as
potent therapeutic regimen in view of 94 discharged patients.
We hope that our findings might be useful to inspire future
clinical research associated with COVID-19 infection.

Methods
Data sources
In this retrospective, single-centre study, all data were collected from a total of 94 patients enrolled from Jan 11th
2020 to Feb 4th 2020 in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital. All of them were confirmed with COVID-19 infection
and discharged up to Feb 13th, 2020. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were
extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients.
The data were analysed and reviewed by a trained team of
physicians. Information including demographic data, exposure history, clinical signs and symptoms, underling comorbidities, medical treatment, laboratory parameters were collected. Nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum and
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained from
patients on admission. The study was approved by Shenzhen
Third People’s Hospital Ethics Committee.
COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR as
described previously [6]. Other respiratory viruses including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,
mycoplasma and chlamydia were also examined with realtime RT-PCR kits approved by the China Food and Drug
Administration. Antiviral drugs of interferon-α, lopinavir/
ritonavir, ribavirin, arbidol, favipiravir, human γ-globulin
and glucocorticoid were used for treatment of these patients.

Statistical analyses
Mean [standard deviation (SD)] and range were reported
for normally distributed, continuous variables. Frequencies
and percentages were reported for categorical variables. The
one way ANOVA was used to compare continuous variable
among three group, while independent samples t test was
used between two groups. The Mann–Whitney U test was
utilized to compare significant differences among continuous
data. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and the p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were done with SPSS software, version 22.0.

Results
Presenting characteristics
Table 1 lists the characteristics of all discharged patients.
The median age for moderate symptom patients was
40 years (range 1–78 years), while 19 years for mildsymptom patients (range 7–39 years), as well as 63 years

13

(range 32–69) for critical patients (one-way ANOVA,
p < 0.0001). Approximately 48 patients (51%) were the
patients aged ≤ 40 years, including 2 children under
3 years. Overall, 15 patients had one or two types of
chronic cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart
disease (CHD), hypertension (HBP) or diabetes (T2DM).
79 of them had resided in Hubei province, while another
13 had the history of contact with Hubei residents. But
none of them were exposed to the Huanan seafood market.
According to our research, 36 of the 94 patients (38%)
were associated with familial clusters. There was no
significant difference among mild, moderate or severe
group of patients by their epidemiology history. However, three groups of patients indeed presented significantly different illness onset on the most common symptoms like fever (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.0089), fatigue
(one-way ANOVA, p = 0.0001) and diarrhea (one-way
ANOVA, p = 0.0486), but not pharyngalgia or dry cough
(Table 1). Besides, the average length of hospital stay
and interferon treatment duration of moderate group were
14.12 (13.34–14.90) days and 14.24 (13.45–15.03) days,
respectively, while those of the severe group took average
2.08 days and 1.44 days longer than total average levels.

Differences on laboratory parameters
Figure 1 showed the outcomes of blood cell counting. On
admission, only the amount of platelets (Fig. 1d) exhibited
obvious differences among three groups (p = 0.006, one way
ANOVA; p < 0.05, severe group vs moderate group). For the
following 6 days, there was no significant difference on numbers of immune cell types until Day 9, when the increased
white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil cell numbers were
significantly higher in severe group comparing with moderate group (Fig. 1a, b). Shown in Fig. 1c with quite distinguishable difference on cell accounts among three group, the
lymphocyte number in severe group remained lower within
the first week of hospitalization (p < 0.05, vs moderate group
on day 3 and 6, respectively). From then on, the lymphocyte
number increased in severe group and turned to as similar
level as other patients.
Figure 2 showed the blood biochemical test at different time points. Among the first 6–9 days of hospitalization, patients in severe group showed significantly higher
levels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and LDH than those
in moderate group (Fig. 2b, c). Except for mild group,
there was a fluctuation around day 3 on hospital in serum
C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels, which then dramatically dropped down around Day 6 to 9 in both moderate
and severe group of patients (Fig. 2a, b). Besides, the CK
concentration declined rapidly in severe group (Fig. 2d). In
contrast, the changes of serum LDH concentration slipped

PCR negative to all undischarged patients by PCR detection
of viral mRNA. The results indicated that the PCR negative
conversion rate was over 50% since Day 6 (59.46%) and kept
increasing up to 95.45% on Day 15 (Table 2). Linear regression analysis was used to study the association between
serum LDH or CK concentrations and PCR negative conversion rate. Figure 3a, b showed that there existed a significant inverse correlation between PCR negative conversion
rate and average CK level (r2 = 0.822, p = 0.0337) instead of
LDH level (r2 = 0.696, p = 0.079). Further revised average
LDH and CK concentrations in PCR positive patients were
all inversely correlated with the negative conversion rate
(r2 = 0.843, p = 0.0279 and r2 = 0.890, p = 0.0161) (Fig. 3c,
d).

ritonavir combined with ribavirin. As shown in Fig. 4a, b,
there was no significant difference on average lengths of hospital stay or PCR negative conversion times among different
antivirus treatment groups. On the other hand, correlation
analysis (Fig. 4c, d) indicated that the duration of hospital
stay was significantly correlated with PCR negative conversion times in IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin group
(p = 0.0215), as well as IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir group
(p = 0.012).

Discussion
In this study, we characterized the changes of several
immune cell types and serum biochemical factors during
hospitalization in 94 discharged patients with COVID19 infection. We found that the decline of LDH and CK
was correlated with viral mRNA elimination, especially
the serum LDH and CK level in virus mRNA positive
patients, suggesting that constitutive decrease of LDH or
CK levels probably predict a favorable response to course

PCR negative conversion rate is calculated by the ratios of PCR negative patients to total detected patients
in each day by virus mRNA RT-PCR

of COVID-19 infected patients. This phenomenon promoted
us to analyze the correlation between COVID-19 clearance
ratio and each of these parameters.
On admission, patients were generally showing symptoms
of fever, dry cough, fatigue and sore throat. Most of the
patients had mild to moderate symptoms. Patients with one
or two underlying chronic diseases tended to develop severe
symptoms. Notably, life-threatening complications such as
acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or multiple organ
failure were not observed in this cohort. Besides, consistent
with previous reports [9, 10], our results showed that 36
patients from 14 different families were clustered, suggesting that person-to-person transmission was efficient in case
of COVID-19.

So far, no antiviral therapy has been proved to be effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection.
A couple of therapeutic interventions for coronavirus were
investigated during the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERSCoV [11, 12], and combination of ribavirin and interferon
has been proved beneficial in patients with SARS-CoV or
MERS-CoV infection [13, 14]. In addition, the potent efficacy of remdesivir [15], lopinavir and ritonavir [16], as well
as intravenous immunoglobulin [17, 18] have been documented for MERS-CoV treatment. As previously reported,
early administration of interferon protected mice from lethal
MERS-CoV infection, while late administration of exogenous interferon promoted the proinflammatory cytokine
response and inhibited the optimal virus-specific T cell

response [19, 20]. In this cohort, 89% of the patients were
hospitalized in 7 days after onset and 71% of them were
treated with interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir, or combined
with ribavirin. As showed in our study, COVID-19 mRNA
conversion time was correlated with the hospital stay length
in both IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-α + lopinavir/
ritonavir + ribavirin treatment group, indicating that these
two therapeutic regimens might be beneficial for treatment
of COVID-19 infected patients.

This study has several limitations. First, only 94 discharged patients were included. Collection of data from a
lager cohort would be better to get a more comprehensive
understanding on discharged patients. Second, we only performed qualitative analysis on viral mRNA. Further quantitative analysis on COVID-19 could be more precise on
evaluations of the efficiency of different therapeutic regimen.
However, we will keep moving on this project in future as
well.
