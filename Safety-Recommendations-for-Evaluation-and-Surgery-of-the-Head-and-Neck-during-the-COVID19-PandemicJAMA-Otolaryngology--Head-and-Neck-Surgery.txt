IMPORTANCE The rapidly expanding novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,

caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has challenged the medical
community to an unprecedented degree. Physicians and health care workers are at added risk
of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of
this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with
the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as
otolaryngologists–head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety
recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with
physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
OBSERVATIONS A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of
the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety
precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers
without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the
examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each
category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific
recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best
practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in
patients with COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top
priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care
systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and
infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care.
The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad
guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.

patient with severe pneumonia before their diagnosis of COVID-19
became infected themselves or developed symptoms. These health
care workers had been present during intubation and extubation of
the patient; they were present for at least 10 minutes at a distance
of less than 2 m from the patient, with 85% wearing a surgical mask
and the remainder wearing N95 masks.
The preservation of this highly skilled, limited workforce should
be a top priority of health care officials and policy makers. At the time
of this writing, to our knowledge, no unified, widely agreed-on protocols exist on how to perform a routine examination of the head and
neck; office-based rigid and flexible endoscopy of the nose, sinuses,
andlarynx;tracheostomy;andothercommonoperations.Somehealth
authorities and societies have developed separate guidelines.4
This article was prepared in consultation with otolaryngologists–
head and neck surgeons and other health care workers in the US,
Asia, and Europe, applying existing guidance from the infection control specialty to physicians potentially at risk from exposure to the

head and neck of infected patients. As the available information
evolves, we expect to modify these guidelines. We expect that each
health authority or organization will make specific decisions appropriate to their community. These recommendations have been developed to give broad guidance to practitioners. Per the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the following factors should
be considered when determining whether a planned examination
or surgical procedure should proceed: current and projected
COVID-19 cases in the facility and region; supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), beds, ventilators, and staff in the facility and
system; health and age of the patients, especially given the risks of
SARS-CoV-2 infection during recovery; and urgency of the
procedure.5 Here, we highlight common procedures that should be
considered and provide a framework on which to base decisions
using the best available evidence. As this is a highly fluid situation,
it is likely that these recommendations will change based on emerging evidence, the infection burden, availability of the health care
workforce, and medical infrastructure.
