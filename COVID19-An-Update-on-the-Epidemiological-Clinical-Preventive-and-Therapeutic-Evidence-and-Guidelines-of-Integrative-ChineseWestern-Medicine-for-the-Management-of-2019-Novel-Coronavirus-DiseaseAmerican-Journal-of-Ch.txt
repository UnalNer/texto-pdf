As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of conﬁrmed COVID-19 have
been documented globally with over 2360 deaths. Common presentations of conﬁrmed cases
include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness
of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated
C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio
is approximately 7–10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5–10.5 days with
mortality of around 1–2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly
identiﬁed virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports
managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and
supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is
proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese
medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1
management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico ﬁndings to identify candidate
Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given the
paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a newly identiﬁed coronavirus sized 60–140 nm
similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV (approximately 80% similar)
that fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the Betacoronavirus genus (Chan et al.,
2020a,b; Chen et al., 2020a; Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Lipsitch
et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020b; Wrapp et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be introduced from wild animals followed by human-to-human
transmission (Chan et al., 2020b; Chen et al., 2020a; Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Huang
et al., 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020b). Genetic epidemiological analysis
showed that the virus may originate from a common ancestor in November–December
2019 from Wuhan, China (GISAID Initiative, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with 10–20 folds higher afﬁnity than SARS-CoV
(Wrapp et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a) with similarities (40%) in the amino acid identity of
Spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD) (Chan et al., 2020a).
At present, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to spread through contact, droplet or fomite
(Van Cuong et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020a). Increasing evidence
also points to the faecal-oral route (Guo et al., 2020; Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Holshue
et al., 2020; Yeo et al., 2020) and aerosol (National Health Commission and National
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2020). Latest data showed that viral load
from nasal swab peaks at 2 days after symptom onset. Nevertheless, comparable viral load
was detected between an asymptomatic patient and other symptomatic patients, and
asymptomatic transmission was reported (Chan et al., 2020b; Guan et al., 2020; Hoehl
et al., 2020; National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020).
As of 22 February 2020, there were 77662 conﬁrmed cases with 2360 deaths, majority
from China, of which over 80% were from Hubei province (Dong et al., 2020; GitHub,
2020; Healthmap, 2020; The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020). A longer time between symptom onset and care seeking at
hospitals or clinics in Hubei was observed when compared to other provinces in China
(Sun et al., 2020a). A sharp increase in conﬁrmed cases was observed on 13 February due
to the inclusion of cases with clinical diagnosis (The State Council, The People’s Republic
of China, 2020b). The current estimated case fatality rate is 1–2% (Guan et al., 2020;
Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2020; The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020; Wang et al., 2020c; Xu et al., 2020d)
which varied geographically being higher in Wuhan (2.9%) (The Novel Coronavirus)
