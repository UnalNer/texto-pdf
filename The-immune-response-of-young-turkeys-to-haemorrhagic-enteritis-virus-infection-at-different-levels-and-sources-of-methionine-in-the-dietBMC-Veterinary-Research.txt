Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) of turkeys was first described in 1937 in the USA, while in Poland it was
first diagnosed in 1987. Polish haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) isolates are usually low pathogenic and trigger a
subclinical disease. Unfortunately, even the low- pathogenic HEV strains cause severe immunosuppression leading
to secondary bacterial infections and huge economic losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the
influence of Met on HEV infected turkeys immune response can be differentiated by both its level and source. Met
is one of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role but also participate in and regulate key metabolic
pathways and immune response. In our study, the birds were assigned to 4 dietary treatments which differed in
Met levels (0.55 and 0.78% in weeks 1–4 of age and 0.45 and 0.65% in weeks 5–8 of age, respectively) and sources
(DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA)).
Results: The HEV added the percentage of CD4+ cells and decreased the percentage of IgM+ cells in the blood,
spleen and caecal tonsils (CTs) of turkeys. In addition, it increased the percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells in blood, and
interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in plasma. The higher dose of Met led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4+,
CD8+ and CD4+IL-6+ cell subpopulations in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys and to an increase in
the percentage of IgM+ B cells in CTs. Turkeys administered feeds with an increased Met content displayed a
decrease in plasma IL-6 levels and an increase in plasma IgA levels.
Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that HEV infection impairs the immune function in turkeys. Met
content in the feed has a moderate effect on the immune response in HEV-infected turkeys. The source of this
amino acid appears not be as important as its dose, because value of the analysed parameters did not differ
significantly between turkeys receiving feeds with DLM or MHA. In the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% (than
recommended by NRC) level of Met in the feeds had a positive effect on humoral immunity parameters.

Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) was first described in turkeys in
1937 by Pomeroy and Fenstermacher at Minnesota, USA [5].
In Poland, it was first diagnosed in 1987 [16]. Haemorrhagic
enteritis virus (HEV) belongs to the family Adenoviridae,
genus Siadenovirus. Under field conditions, susceptible to
HEV infection are mainly turkeys over 4–6 weeks of life,
whereas disease develops most often in 7–9 week old birds.
HEV infection is usually asymptomatic. It may, however,
proceed with depression, sanguineous excreta, and mortality
rate approximating 80% only in the case of infection with
highly pathogenic strains [5, 16, 40]. The Polish HEV isolates
are usually low-pathogenic and induce subclinical infections,
but severely impair the humoral and cellular reactivity of the
immune system. At the acute stage of the disease, the percentage of B lymphocytes decreases significantly in blood
and many immune organs, and the balance between percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes is upset [40]. HEV
has been shown to infect macrophages and reduce their
functional capabilities. HEV-infected macrophages may
undergo necrosis and apoptosis [28]. This may enhance the
susceptibility to bacterial (usually E. coli and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT)) and other viral infections in
HEV-infected turkeys [5, 16, 17, 27].. An increased mortality
rate due to superinfections with E. coli bacteria is usually observed between week 2 and 4 of life after infection with a
low-pathogenic HE virus and may range from 2.5 to 6.5%
weekly [24]. Considering the frequent exposure of turkeys to
HEV infections and, consequently, their suppressed immunity, any actions aimed at aiding defence mechanisms in the
course of the infection should be deemed highly desirable
and valuable. One of the means to improve the health status
of turkeys in commercial production is to supplement their
feed mixtures with substances exhibiting immunostimulating
effects. This is expected to alleviate negative outcomes of
HEV and improve the birds health status and resultantly (by
decreasing amounts of antibiotics used) to improve turkey
production effectiveness and quality of poultry products. The
substances with proved, positive impact on the immune system of poultry and their body weight gains include, i.a., vitamins, probiotics, essential oils, herbs, nucleotides, and amino
acids [4, 18, 19].
Methionine (Met) is the first limiting amino acid in
feeds of poultry because the Met content of natural feed
ingredients is generally low (0.3–0.4%), below the requirements of fast-growing chickens and turkeys [12, 29]. Dietary Met content should be higher particularly in the first
month of rearing, at 0.55% or even 0.70%, according to
the recommendations of NRC [23] and British United
Turkeys [2], respectively. Therefore, commercial feeds are
usually supplemented with feed-grade Met, i.e. DLmethionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue
(MHA) [43]. Chemically, MHA is not an amino acid but a
metabolic precursor of DLM and a very effective source of

supplemental Met [7, 41]. Some studies have revealed
MHA to be more effective in improving the antioxidant
status of chickens and turkeys than DLM [25, 38, 42].
The results of recent research indicate that Met is one
of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role
but also participate in and regulate key metabolic pathways [1, 11, 22] including those related to the immune
system function [12, 13, 19]. One of the mechanisms
proposed to explain Met interference in the immune
system is the proliferation of T cells that are sensitive to
intracellular variations in glutathione and cysteine levels,
i.e. compounds which also participate in Met metabolism [8, 15]. The findings of other authors indicate that
dietary Met can be a major contributor to the synthesis
of immune system proteins, including antibodies such as
IgA [44]. IgA is a major immunoglobulin synthesized locally and secreted onto the surface of mucous membranes of respiratory airways, gastrointestinal tract,
reproductive system, and many other sites. It represents
the main element of mucosal immune system. In blood
serum, it circulates in the form of monomers in secretions with a dimer, a trimer or a tetramer. Mucosal IgA
possesses a secretory component (SC) which promotes
its adhesion to epithelial surface and provides protection
from proteolytic degradation within cells [10].
Experimental evidence [3, 37] has shown that
humoral stimulation and cellular immune responses
were enhanced in broiler chickens administered feeds
supplemented with Met in excess of NRC dietary recommendations [23]. In a study by Jankowski et al.
[14], an increase in plasma IL-6 levels was noted in
turkeys administered feeds with a higher Met content.
In other experiment on young turkeys, the higher
dietary Met content elevated IgA concentration and
decreased IL-6 plasma level [45]. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a major role in regulating
immune responses, acute phase reactions and haematopoiesis. It is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in both
birds and mammals and is produced early after infection as part of the induced innate immune response.
IL-6 plays a pivotal role during the transition from
innate to acquired immunity, and is also involved in
the regulation of metabolic, regenerative, and neural
processes. This cytokine is produced by many different cell types (monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes,
fibroblasts, endothelial cells and chondrocytes) and
acts on T cells, B cells, hepatocytes, haematopoietic
progenitor cells and cells of the central nervous system [30, 31]. In addition, IL-6 plays a key role in the
development of inflammatory lesions in intestinal mucosa of HEV-infected turkeys [27].
The available literature provides no information on the effects of Met on the immune system functioning in turkeys
infected with a pathogen with a strong immunosuppressive

The average body weight (BW) of 56-day-old uninfected
and HEV-infected turkeys ranged from 3.94 to 4.06 kg,
and from 3.87 to 4.02 kg, respectively. No significant differences in BW were found between HEV-infected and
uninfected turkeys administered feeds supplemented
with DLM or MHA. From the day of experimental infection (42 days of age) until the end of the experiment (56
days of age), no mortality was recorded in the infected
and uninfected groups.
Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the percentages of CD4+,
CD4+CD25+, CD8+, CD4+CD8+ T cell subpopulations
and IgM+ B cell subpopulation within the mononuclear
cells isolated from the blood, spleen and caecal tonsils
(CTs) of 47-day-old uninfected (0) and HEV- infected
(HE) turkeys from groups DLML, MHAL, DLMH and
MHAH. The percentages of the analysed T cell and B
cell subpopulations in the blood (Table 1), spleen
(Table 2) and CTs (Table 3) of turkeys were most influenced by HEV infection, followed by dietary Met levels
(which exerted a weaker effect on the analysed parameters) and Met sources (which exerted a minor effect). In
the acute phase of infection (first 5 days post inoculation
(p.i.)), the HEV-infected turkeys displayed a significant
increase in the percentage of CD4+ cells and a decrease
in the percentage of IgM+ B cells in blood (both P <
0.001), spleen (both P < 0.001) and CTs (P = 0.005 and
P < 0.001, respectively), compared with the uninfected
birds. The higher dose of Met, regardless of its source,
led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4+
cell (P = 0.009) and CD8+ cell (P = 0.027) subpopulations
in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys
(Table 1), and an increase in the percentage of IgM+ B
cells (P = 0.015) in CTs (Table 3).
Both the HEV experimental infection and increased
dietary Met content contributed to a significant (P <
0.001) decrease in the blood percentage of CD4+ cells,
synthesizing IL-6 in response to mitogenic stimulation
under in vitro conditions. The HEV infection had a similar effect on IL-6 synthesis by CD4+ cells isolated from
the spleen and CTs of turkeys (Table 4).
A significant (P < 0.001) increase in plasma IL-6 concentrations was noted in the HEV-infected turkeys, compared
