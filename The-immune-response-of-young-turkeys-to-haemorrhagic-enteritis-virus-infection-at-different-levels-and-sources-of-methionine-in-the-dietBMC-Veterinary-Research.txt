Abstract
Background: Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) of turkeys was first described in 1937 in the USA, while in Poland it was
first diagnosed in 1987. Polish haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) isolates are usually low pathogenic and trigger a
subclinical disease. Unfortunately, even the low- pathogenic HEV strains cause severe immunosuppression leading
to secondary bacterial infections and huge economic losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the
influence of Met on HEV infected turkeys immune response can be differentiated by both its level and source. Met
is one of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role but also participate in and regulate key metabolic
pathways and immune response. In our study, the birds were assigned to 4 dietary treatments which differed in
Met levels (0.55 and 0.78% in weeks 1–4 of age and 0.45 and 0.65% in weeks 5–8 of age, respectively) and sources
(DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA)).
Results: The HEV added the percentage of CD4+ cells and decreased the percentage of IgM+ cells in the blood,
spleen and caecal tonsils (CTs) of turkeys. In addition, it increased the percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells in blood, and
interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in plasma. The higher dose of Met led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4+,
CD8+ and CD4+IL-6+ cell subpopulations in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys and to an increase in
the percentage of IgM+ B cells in CTs. Turkeys administered feeds with an increased Met content displayed a
decrease in plasma IL-6 levels and an increase in plasma IgA levels.
Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that HEV infection impairs the immune function in turkeys. Met
content in the feed has a moderate effect on the immune response in HEV-infected turkeys. The source of this
amino acid appears not be as important as its dose, because value of the analysed parameters did not differ
significantly between turkeys receiving feeds with DLM or MHA. In the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% (than
recommended by NRC) level of Met in the feeds had a positive effect on humoral immunity parameters.

Background
Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) was first described in turkeys in
1937 by Pomeroy and Fenstermacher at Minnesota, USA [5].
In Poland, it was first diagnosed in 1987 [16]. Haemorrhagic
enteritis virus (HEV) belongs to the family Adenoviridae,
genus Siadenovirus. Under field conditions, susceptible to
HEV infection are mainly turkeys over 4–6 weeks of life,
whereas disease develops most often in 7–9 week old birds.
HEV infection is usually asymptomatic. It may, however,
proceed with depression, sanguineous excreta, and mortality
rate approximating 80% only in the case of infection with
highly pathogenic strains [5, 16, 40]. The Polish HEV isolates
are usually low-pathogenic and induce subclinical infections,
but severely impair the humoral and cellular reactivity of the
immune system. At the acute stage of the disease, the percentage of B lymphocytes decreases significantly in blood
and many immune organs, and the balance between percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes is upset [40]. HEV
has been shown to infect macrophages and reduce their
functional capabilities. HEV-infected macrophages may
undergo necrosis and apoptosis [28]. This may enhance the
susceptibility to bacterial (usually E. coli and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT)) and other viral infections in
HEV-infected turkeys [5, 16, 17, 27].. An increased mortality
rate due to superinfections with E. coli bacteria is usually observed between week 2 and 4 of life after infection with a
low-pathogenic HE virus and may range from 2.5 to 6.5%
weekly [24]. Considering the frequent exposure of turkeys to
HEV infections and, consequently, their suppressed immunity, any actions aimed at aiding defence mechanisms in the
course of the infection should be deemed highly desirable
and valuable. One of the means to improve the health status
of turkeys in commercial production is to supplement their
feed mixtures with substances exhibiting immunostimulating
effects. This is expected to alleviate negative outcomes of
HEV and improve the birds health status and resultantly (by
decreasing amounts of antibiotics used) to improve turkey
production effectiveness and quality of poultry products. The
substances with proved, positive impact on the immune system of poultry and their body weight gains include, i.a., vitamins, probiotics, essential oils, herbs, nucleotides, and amino
acids [4, 18, 19].
Methionine (Met) is the first limiting amino acid in
feeds of poultry because the Met content of natural feed
ingredients is generally low (0.3–0.4%), below the requirements of fast-growing chickens and turkeys [12, 29]. Dietary Met content should be higher particularly in the first
month of rearing, at 0.55% or even 0.70%, according to
the recommendations of NRC [23] and British United
Turkeys [2], respectively. Therefore, commercial feeds are
usually supplemented with feed-grade Met, i.e. DLmethionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue
(MHA) [43]. Chemically, MHA is not an amino acid but a
metabolic precursor of DLM and a very effective source of

Page 2 of 11

supplemental Met [7, 41]. Some studies have revealed
MHA to be more effective in improving the antioxidant
status of chickens and turkeys than DLM [25, 38, 42].
The results of recent research indicate that Met is one
of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role
but also participate in and regulate key metabolic pathways [1, 11, 22] including those related to the immune
system function [12, 13, 19]. One of the mechanisms
proposed to explain Met interference in the immune
system is the proliferation of T cells that are sensitive to
intracellular variations in glutathione and cysteine levels,
i.e. compounds which also participate in Met metabolism [8, 15]. The findings of other authors indicate that
dietary Met can be a major contributor to the synthesis
of immune system proteins, including antibodies such as
IgA [44]. IgA is a major immunoglobulin synthesized locally and secreted onto the surface of mucous membranes of respiratory airways, gastrointestinal tract,
reproductive system, and many other sites. It represents
the main element of mucosal immune system. In blood
serum, it circulates in the form of monomers in secretions with a dimer, a trimer or a tetramer. Mucosal IgA
possesses a secretory component (SC) which promotes
its adhesion to epithelial surface and provides protection
from proteolytic degradation within cells [10].
Experimental evidence [3, 37] has shown that
humoral stimulation and cellular immune responses
were enhanced in broiler chickens administered feeds
supplemented with Met in excess of NRC dietary recommendations [23]. In a study by Jankowski et al.
[14], an increase in plasma IL-6 levels was noted in
turkeys administered feeds with a higher Met content.
In other experiment on young turkeys, the higher
dietary Met content elevated IgA concentration and
decreased IL-6 plasma level [45]. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a major role in regulating
immune responses, acute phase reactions and haematopoiesis. It is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in both
birds and mammals and is produced early after infection as part of the induced innate immune response.
IL-6 plays a pivotal role during the transition from
innate to acquired immunity, and is also involved in
the regulation of metabolic, regenerative, and neural
processes. This cytokine is produced by many different cell types (monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes,
fibroblasts, endothelial cells and chondrocytes) and
acts on T cells, B cells, hepatocytes, haematopoietic
progenitor cells and cells of the central nervous system [30, 31]. In addition, IL-6 plays a key role in the
development of inflammatory lesions in intestinal mucosa of HEV-infected turkeys [27].
The available literature provides no information on the effects of Met on the immune system functioning in turkeys
infected with a pathogen with a strong immunosuppressive

activity. One of the objectives of this study was to evaluate if
the influence of Met on the immune system functioning can
be differentiated by both its level and source. Additionally,
we have compared the immune responses of healthy and
HEV- infected turkeys, administered feeds (1–8 weeks of
age) containing two sources of Met (DLM and MHA) at
two inclusion levels: recommended by NRC [23] (DLML
and MHAL groups) and approximately 40% higher than that
recommended by NRC (DLMH and MHAH groups).

Results
The average body weight (BW) of 56-day-old uninfected
and HEV-infected turkeys ranged from 3.94 to 4.06 kg,
and from 3.87 to 4.02 kg, respectively. No significant differences in BW were found between HEV-infected and
uninfected turkeys administered feeds supplemented
with DLM or MHA. From the day of experimental infection (42 days of age) until the end of the experiment (56
days of age), no mortality was recorded in the infected
and uninfected groups.
Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the percentages of CD4+,
CD4+CD25+, CD8+, CD4+CD8+ T cell subpopulations
and IgM+ B cell subpopulation within the mononuclear
cells isolated from the blood, spleen and caecal tonsils
(CTs) of 47-day-old uninfected (0) and HEV- infected
(HE) turkeys from groups DLML, MHAL, DLMH and
MHAH. The percentages of the analysed T cell and B
cell subpopulations in the blood (Table 1), spleen
(Table 2) and CTs (Table 3) of turkeys were most influenced by HEV infection, followed by dietary Met levels
(which exerted a weaker effect on the analysed parameters) and Met sources (which exerted a minor effect). In
the acute phase of infection (first 5 days post inoculation
(p.i.)), the HEV-infected turkeys displayed a significant
increase in the percentage of CD4+ cells and a decrease
in the percentage of IgM+ B cells in blood (both P <
0.001), spleen (both P < 0.001) and CTs (P = 0.005 and
P < 0.001, respectively), compared with the uninfected
birds. The higher dose of Met, regardless of its source,
led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4+
cell (P = 0.009) and CD8+ cell (P = 0.027) subpopulations
in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys
(Table 1), and an increase in the percentage of IgM+ B
cells (P = 0.015) in CTs (Table 3).
Both the HEV experimental infection and increased
dietary Met content contributed to a significant (P <
0.001) decrease in the blood percentage of CD4+ cells,
synthesizing IL-6 in response to mitogenic stimulation
under in vitro conditions. The HEV infection had a similar effect on IL-6 synthesis by CD4+ cells isolated from
the spleen and CTs of turkeys (Table 4).
A significant (P < 0.001) increase in plasma IL-6 concentrations was noted in the HEV-infected turkeys, compared

Anti-ND antibody titres were not significantly affected
by dietary Met sources or levels, but they were significantly (P = 0.004) lower in the HEV-infected turkeys
than in the uninfected birds (Table 6). Average vaccineinduced anti-ORT antibody titres were significantly (P <

Discussion
No deterioration of production performance was observed in our study for the HEV-infected turkeys administered feeds supplemented with DLM or MHA. The

secondary bacterial infections, it does not increase birds
mortality or significant changes in BW. However, even
low-virulence strains that cause subclinical infection can
result in immunosuppression [16, 17, 40].
Results of our study indicate that the HEV infection
strongly influences the immune system of turkeys,
which leads to a significant increase in the percentage
of CD4+ cells and a decrease in the percentage of
IgM+ B cells in their blood, spleen, and CTs. Present
results corroborate previous findings [17, 36]. There is
a scarcity of studies investigating the effect of HEV on
the percentages of the analysed cell subsets in CTs.
Regulatory T cells (Treg), a subset of T cells identified
by the co-expression of CD4 and CD25, suppress immune responses to self-antigens and prevent autoimmune diseases. There is emerging evidence to

suggest that regulatory T cells control immune responses to bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi [21].
Regulatory T cells have been identified in several species, including humans, dogs, cats, pigs, cows, sheep,
horses, chickens and turkeys [6, 32, 33]. The mechanism of the suppressive function of natural and inducible regulatory T cells is still debated, but in different
model systems, suppressive activity has been shown to
be mediated either through secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines or through cell–cell contact [21].
Many studies have shown that pathogens, in particular
those that cause chronic infections or are associated with immunosuppression, induce the production of regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β [20]. Turkey thymic CD4+CD25+
cells have approximately 158-fold higher IL-10 mRNA, 7fold higher TGF-β, 24-fold higher CTLA-4 and 11-fold

There is a scarcity of studies investigating the role of regulatory T cells in the course of HEV infection in turkeys. In
the current study, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells increased significantly in the blood of HEV-infected turkeys
on day 5 p.i. A significant increase in the percentage of
CD4+CD25+ cells was also noted in the CTs of the turkeys
administered MHA-supplemented feeds relative to the birds
fed DLM-supplemented feed mixtures. Our results and the
findings of other authors [9, 28, 36] indicate that HEV impairs immune function in infected turkeys, leading to strong
immunosuppression. After exposure, HEV may replicate in
B lymphocytes located in the intestines and the bursa of
Fabricius, or it may travel directly to the spleen through peripheral blood infecting numerous macrophages and B cells,

and replicate efficiently [35]. The infection of target cells in
the spleen leads to the influx of macrophages and CD4+ T
cells in the white pulp, resulting in hyperplasia. The activation of macrophages by HEV leads to the production of cytokines such as IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and
interferon (IFN) type I and II [28]. In the acute phase of the
disease, the depletion of IgM+ B cells occurs in the blood
and spleen of birds [17, 36]. Virus-induced cell necrosis and
apoptosis may compromise the antigen-presenting function
and possibly other functions of macrophages and B cells. In
the present study, the higher dietary Met level induced a
lesser decrease in the percentage of IgM+ B cells in HEVinfected turkeys, particularly in their CTs.
Results of our study demonstrate that the higher supplementation levels of Met, used in the form of DLM

and MHA, reduced the blood level of IL-6 in both the
HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys. IL-6 plays a major
role in regulating immune responses and acute phase reactions [30, 31]. It is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and is
produced early (2–3 days p.i) after HEV infection as part
of the induced innate immune response. It appears that
in our study, cells other than CD4+ lymphocytes, activated by HEV, secreted IL-6 and contributed to an increase in the plasma concentrations of this interleukin.
Earlier investigations conducted by other authors have
demonstrated high IL-6 and TNF level at the peak of the
acute phase in HEV-infected turkeys. Cytokines may
play a protective as well as a destructive role. While a
massive release of proinflammatory cytokines may lead
to systemic shock associated with haemorrhagic enteritis
and death [27].

Immunosuppression induced by HEV infection may
impair post-vaccination immunity after the administration of live vaccines, which was observed in the
current study in turkeys vaccinated against ND. Usually, once-vaccinated turkeys do not develop high
levels of serum antibodies as detected in the ELISA
test. Our findings correspond to the observations of
other authors [9]. In turkeys that had been vaccinated
twice against ORT with an inactivated vaccine,
vaccine-induced antibody titres were significantly
higher in the serum of 56-day-old birds administered
feeds with increased Met content, which corroborates
the findings of Kubińska et al. [19]. Average plasma
IgA levels were also higher in turkeys receiving higher
Met concentrations. Our findings are consistent with
the results of other studies which show that dietary
Met can be a major contributor to the synthesis of immune system proteins, including IgA [12, 44].
Interesting results of serological analyses were obtained
in the HEV-infected turkeys that were revaccinated
against ORT at 49 days of age (7 days p.i.). Over that
period, the number of HEV Hexon gene copies, determined in the spleen by qPCR, is higher than 3 and 14 days
p.i. (Tykałowski B, unpublished data). Despite this fact,
average vaccine-induced anti-ORT antibody titres were
higher at 56 days of age in the HEV-infected turkeys than
in the uninfected birds. The increase in anti-ORT antibody titres could have resulted from the activation of the
immune system of the HEV-infected turkeys. Similar results were reported by Rautenschlein and Sharma [26]. In
the cited study, 5- to 6-week-old turkeys were simultaneously vaccinated with attenuated NDV-B1 ELD50 = 105
/bird intraocular) and cell culture-adapted HEV (HEVp30)
at TCID50 = 104 /bird per os. At 14 days post vaccination,
the anti-NDV antibody response was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) in HEVp30 + NDV-vaccinated turkeys
in comparison with the single-inoculated birds. At 21 days
post vaccination, anti-HEV and anti-NDV antibody responses were similar in all vaccinated groups. However,
the combination of HEVp30 and NDV-B1 enhanced the
rate of apoptosis in splenic cells. However, the mechanism
of the enhancement of anti-NDV antibodies remains
unknown.

Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that HEV infection
impairs immune function in turkeys. Depending on
its content in the feed, methionine used in our study
moderately affected the immune response of HEVinfected turkeys by alleviating infection outcomes.
The source of this exogenous amino acid is not as
important as its dose is, because values of the analysed parameters did not differ significantly between
turkeys administered feeds with DLM or MHA. In

Tykałowski et al. BMC Veterinary Research

the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% level of
methionine in the feed (than that recommended by
NRC) had a positive effect on humoral immunity parameters, causing an increase both in the percentage
of B lymphocytes in blood, spleen and CTs, and in
plasma level of IgA.

Methods
Birds, management and feeds

The study was conducted on 240 day-old female Hybrid
Converter turkey poults purchased from a local hatchery
(Grelavi S.A., Ketrzyn, Poland) and kept in isolated pens
in the Pavilion of Avian Experimental Infections of the
Department of Avian Diseases of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. The facility conforms to the
relevant biosafety level (BSL-3). The birds were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatments (60 birds per
treatment). Each treatment was further divided into two
groups (kept in 2 separate isolated pens, 30 birds per
group). The total number of birds in each group was
adapted to the size of experimental boxes. The dietary
treatments differed in the level (low - “L”or high – “H”)
and the source (DLM or MHA) of Met in feed. In each
dietary treatment (DLML, MHAL, DLMH and MHAH,
respectively), one group was inoculated with HEV and
the other group served as uninfected control. The experiment layout is presented in Table 7.
The temperature and lighting programs were consistent with the recommendations of Hendrix Genetics Ltd.
(Canada) for Hybrid Converter turkeys. The birds had

free access to feed and water. All experimental procedures were consistent with permission No. 45/2013 of
the Local Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments in
Olsztyn (Poland). NRC [23] recommendations were
adopted as the low dietary levels of DLM (Evonik Industries, Krefeld, Germany) and MHA (calcium salt of 2hydroxy-4-(methyl) butanoic acid, Novus International,
Inc., USA). The dietary Met content increased by 40%
relative to NRC [23] recommendations was regarded as
the high level which contributed to achieving good
turkey performance in previous experiments [13, 18, 19].
The nutritional value of basal feeds prepared in two
successive 4-week periods (Table 8) was calculated according to the Polish Feedstuff Analysis Tables [34]. The
analytically verified total Met content of experimental
feeds, i.e. the lower and higher dietary levels of Met (including the equivalent amount of MHA), was 0.55 and
0.78% in weeks 1–4 of age, respectively, and 0.45 and
0.65% in weeks 5–8 of age, respectively.
Vaccination

Experimental turkeys fell under a standard vaccination
program, practiced at commercial farms in Poland. At 10
days of age, all 240 turkeys were vaccinated against Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The vaccine (Nobilis® ND,
Clone 30, MSD, USA) was administered in a dose recommended by the producer with a dropper at one drop (0.05
ml) per bird into one eye. At 28 and 49 days of age, turkeys were vaccinated against ORT by subcutaneous administration of 0.5 ml of Ornitin vaccine (ABIC, Poland).

The immunological parameters were determined in blood,
spleen and CTs. For this study, 7 turkeys at 47 days of life
(representing average BW ± 10% per pen) were selected from
each group, commonly accepted as the minimum number of
turkeys with a unified genotype that ensures reliable, reproducible and statistically significant results without repeating
the procedure due to high intra-group variability. Blood samples were collected from the wing vein into sterile test tubes
(BD Vacutainer®, USA) with the K2EDTA anticoagulant for
flow cytometry or with lithium heparin for biochemical analysis. Selected birds from each group were euthanized and
their spleen and CTs were collected for mononuclear cell
isolation and determination of the percentages of CD4+,
CD8+, CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD25+, CD4+IL-6+ T cell subpopulations and IgM+ B cell subpopulation, by flow cytometry.
Humanitarian euthanasia of the birds was performed with
the use of a professional UNO Euthanasia Unit (UNOBV,
Netherlands). The turkeys were placed in a chamber to
which Carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) was provided by the
unit. After 1 min, Carbogen flow was stopped and 100% CO2
was introduced into the cage. In this way, the high concentration of O2 was slowly replaced by CO2. This relatively
slow replacement of O2 by CO2 is responsible for stress reduction in the birds.
At 56 days of age, all turkeys were weighed, and blood
samples were collected from 23 birds per treatment into
sterile test tubes without the anticoagulant for serological analysis.

Experimental inoculation with HEV

At 42 days of age, turkeys from HE-DLML, HE-MHAL,
HE-DLMH, and HE-MHAH groups were experimentally
inoculated with 1 ml of a suspension containing HEV at
a dose of 104,3 EID50, administered into the crop with a
probe [16]. In turn, turkeys from 0-DLML, 0-MHAL, 0DLMH, and 0-MHAH group received 1 ml of PBS via the
same route.
Sample collection

Sample collection times and experiment design were
presented in Table 7. All activities (vaccination, infection, sample collection) were performed between 7.00
and 8.00 a.m.

Determination of the percentages of selected T cell and B
cell subpopulations in blood, spleen and CTs

Viable mononuclear cells (1 × 106) were stained with
fluorescein conjugated Mouse Anti-Chicken CD4-FITC
(MCA2164F, Bio-Rad, UK), phycoerythrin conjugated
Mouse Anti-Chicken CD8a-RPE (MCA2166PE, Bio-Rad,
UK) and Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugated Human AntiChicken CD25 (HCA173A647, Bio-Rad, UK) or Alexa
Fluor® 647- conjugated Negative Control Antibody
(HCA052A647, Bio-Rad, UK). B cells were stained separately with FITC-conjugated Goat Anti-Chicken IgM
(AAI27F, Bio-Rad, UK). The percentages of CD4+,
CD4+CD25+, CD8+, CD4+CD8+ and IgM+ cells were determined in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD, USA).
Cell staining, acquisition and analysis of cytometric data
were described elsewhere [18].

Determination of the percentage of IL-6 synthesizing cells
within the CD4+ subpopulation

Mononuclear cells isolated from blood, spleen and CTs
were individually transferred at 2 × 106 to 24-well plates
(Corning, USA). Each well contained 2 ml of complete culture medium (RPMI-1640, 20 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), 4 μl
of Leukocyte Activation Cocktail with BD GolgiPlug™ (BD
Pharmingen, USA) and 0.3 μg/ml of co-stimulatory Mouse
Anti-Chicken CD28 monoclonal antibody (MCA5760,
clone AV7, Bio-Rad, UK). Cells collected from each turkey
were analysed in triplicate. The cells were incubated at a
temperature of 40 °C (5% CO2) for 6 h. After incubation,
20 μl of 20 mM EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)
in PBS was added to each well. The contents of each well
were individually transferred to test-tubes, and were rinsed
twice with PBS supplemented with 1% FBS. The cells were
stained with Mouse Anti-Chicken CD4-FITC monoclonal
antibody (MCA2164F, clone 2–35, Biorad, UK). The samples were incubated on ice in darkness for 30 min, and were
rinsed with PBS. The cells were fixed with 100 μl of Leucoperm reagent A (Biorad, UK), and were incubated at room
temperature for 15 min. After incubation they were washed
with PBS at 300 g for 5 min. Afterwards, they were suspended in 100 μl of permeabilization medium (Reagent B,
Leucoperm, Biorad, UK), and 5 μl of Rabbit Anti-Chicken
IL-6 antibody was added (AHP942Z, Biorad, UK). Thoroughly mixed samples were incubated at room temperature
in darkness for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were
washed with PBS. The cells were suspended in 100 μl of
PBS, and 5 μl of secondary antibodies Sheep Anti Rabbit
IgG:PE (STAR35A, Bio-Rad, UK) was added. The samples
were incubated at room temperature in darkness for 30
min. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS.
Final cell pellets were suspended in 400 μl of PBS, and analysed with FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD, USA).
A fluorescence minus one (FMO) control was prepared for each analysed sample. Primary Anti-Chicken
IL-6 antibodies were not added to FMO controls. The
cytometer setup and tracking beads (CST, BD, USA)
were used to initialise photomultiplier tubes settings.
Unstained and single-stained control cells for each
fluorochrome were prepared and used to set up flow cytometry compensation.
Biochemical and serological analyses

Immediately after collection, blood samples were centrifuged (15 min, 380 g, 4 °C) and the obtained plasma or
serum was stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Plasma levels
of IgA and IL-6 were determined with the use of the
Bigenet UMV340 blood cell reader (Horiba, Kyoto,
Japan) and kits for determining IL-6 (SEA079Ga, Wuhan
USCN Business Co., China) and IgA (CSB-E11232Ch,
Cusabio Biotech Co., China).

Page 9 of 11

Vaccine-induced titres of serum antibody against ORT
and ND were determined with the use of commercial
ELISA kits (Idexx Laboratories, USA). The analytical
procedure was consistent with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Absorbance was measured with the Elx
800 spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). The results were
analysed using the xChek 3.3 programme (Idexx Laboratories, USA).
Statistical analysis

The results were analysed statistically by three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using STATISTICA software
version 12.0 (StatSoft Inc., USA). The significance of differences between means was determined by the F-test
and Duncan’s multiple range test. Data are presented as
means ± SEM and the value of p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. SEM was estimated by dividing
the standard deviation by the square root of replication
number.
