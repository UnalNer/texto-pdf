[ABSTRACT] The rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is vital for the prevention of outbreaks of infectious diseases, including infections by the common foodborne bacteria E.coli and Salmonella Carbohydrate microarrays have been developed as a powerful method to investigate carbohydrate-protein interaction with only very small amounts of glycans, which show great potential for detect the
carbohydrate mediated interaction with pathogens. Here, different mannose-coated microarrays were constructed and tested with E.coli
(K−12 and BL−21) and Salmonella enterica strains (ATCC9184 and ATCC31685) exhibiting different mannose binding affinities. The
optimized carbohydrate microarray was then applied to test the binding of 12 Salmonella enterica and 9 E.coli isolates from local patients for the first time and showed strong binding with certain serovars or subtypes. The results showed that microarray probed with
the single mannose structure is not enough for the detection of bacteria with various serovars or subtypes, which contain a high degree
of allelic variation in adhesin. We suggest that a complex carbohydrate microarray containing different glycan conformation may be
needed for detection of different bacteria isolates.

Introduction
Gram-negative bacteria can cause various types of infections to humans. The main concern is the increasing multidrug resistant strains of many species, including Escherichia
coli (E.coli) and Salmonella [1-4] which are common causes of
foodborne disease. Recently, diseases caused by foodborne
pathogens have drawn more attention with high morbidity
and mortality rates, high costs and threats to public health [5].

ic microorganisms in food, detection of pathogenic bacteria
remains the key to prevent the outbreaks [6-7]. The conventional culture-dependent screen-out methods are often time-consuming and laborious [8] . In past decades, many technologies
have been developed to achieve rapid and simple detection,
including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunological detection [9-12].
Carbohydrates are abundant in living organisms and their
specific interactions with proteins play a vital role in a variety of biological recognition processes to enable cell adhesion and communication, fertilization, differentiation, development and metastasis of tumor cell [13-15] . Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are found to attach to the glycans on the
surface of host cells that are often the targets of bacterial toxins [16] through the carbohydrate-protein interactions and then
present pathogenic properties [13-15].
Many conventional approaches such as isothermal titration calorimetry [17-18] , surface plasmon resonance biosensing [19-20] and affinity capillary electrophoresis [21] have been
limited for the use in studies of the carbohydrate-protein interactions by the low amount of available carbohydrates.

With the successful development of DNA and protein microarrays, carbohydrate microarrays are emerging as a key
method for rapid and high-throughput protein analysis requiring only very small amounts of carbohydrates [22-23] . The carbohydrate-coated microarrays have been reported to be applied in study of the interactions of carbohydrate-bacteria and
showed great potential for pathogens detection [24-25] . Since
there are complex components in food samples that causing
severe interferences with antibody binding or nucleids detection processes, carbohydrate microarrays can capture target
bacteria throughout the carbohydrate-protein interaction.
FimH protein, on the tip of the fimbriae shaft, is a lectin-like
adhesin responsible for the adhesion of type 1 fimbriae of
enterobacteria with host cells by the specific binding to Dmannose residues [26] . It has showed that E.coli and Salmonella strains can both be detected with mannose-coated microarrays [24, 27-28].
In order to optimize the detection of bacteria, different
linkers between surface and carbohydrates have been prepared to the determine the appropriate distance for the bacteria-glycan binding. Also, different types of glycan immobilization through chemical approaches have been tested for
presenting the carbohydrates on the surface in a suitable
three-dimensional manner. The optimized carbohydrate microarray has been applied for test of Salmonella enterica and
E.coli and isolates from infected patients.The results showed
that most isolates can be tested significantly, while some isolates showed weak fluorescence mostly due to weak binding
affinities of their FimH variants towards the immobilized
mannosides.

Experimental Section
Functionalization of slides
The slides were rinsed three times with distilled water
and three times with 95% ethanol, dried by centrifugation.
Subsequently, the slides were immersed in piranha solution
for 2 h at 70 ºC, and washed three times with ethanol.
The thiol (SH) slides were immersed in anhydrous ethanol containing 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane and acetic
acid. The slides were incubated in this solution for 12 h at
40 ºC, washed three times with ethanol, and stored in a vacuum dessicator until use.
The NHS slides were immersed in anhydrous ethanol
containing 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and acetic acid. The
slides were incubated in this solution for 6 h at 40 ºC, washed
three times with ethanol, and vacuum drying for 2 h. Then the
slides were immersed in anhydrous DMF containing tetraethylene glycol disuccinimidyl disuccinate (TGDD) and
diisopropylamine. The slides were incubated for 12 h at 40
ºC, washed three times with ethanol, and stored in vacuum
desiccator until use.
The functionalized slides were detected with fluorescein
staining for quality control. The functionalized slides were
randomly chosen and printed with FITC solved in DMSO (1
mg·mL−1 ) and vacuum dried at 80 ºC for 1 h. The slides were

scanned with fluorescent slide reader to give fluorescent
density referred as F1. The slides were then washed with SSC
(2 × ) buffer and 1% SDS for 5 min, respectively and then
dried by centrifugation. The slides were scanned again to give
F2. The slides were functionalized successfully when F2/F1 >
0.5.
Microspotting of carbohydrates
The mannoses probes dissolved in PBS containing 30%
glycerol were printed in predetermined places on glass slide
with a distance of 971 μm between the center of adjacent
spots (spot size, ca. 200 μm, calc. automatically by the system) by using Arrayjet microarray systems. Prints were performed in a humid chamber at 20 ºC.
After printing, the SH slides were immediately placed in
a humid chamber at 26 ºC for 12 h and then the unreacted thiols were capped by immersing them into a solution of PBS
buffer (pH 6.8) that contained 1% N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)
for 15 min with gentle shaking. The slides were then washed
with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by wash of deionized water and then dried by centrifugation. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with buffer
that contained 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA for 1 h and then
the slides were washed with the same buffer without BSA.
After printing, the NHS slides was placed in a humid
chamber at 26 ºC for 12 h and then vacuum drying in vacuum drying oven. The slides were then washed with PBS (pH
7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then rinsed with PBS (pH
7.4). Subsequently, the slides were incubated with buffer that
contained 0.1%Tween 20 and 1% BSA for 1 h and then
washed with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and
rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4), and then dried.
Bacteria Culture
Bacterial strains Salmonella
ATCC31685 and
ATCC9184 were purchased from ATCC cell lines. E.coli K12 and BL-21 were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. RAO Yi-Jian from Jiangnan University.
E.coli and Salmonella strains isolated from local patients
were provided by the Wuxi CDC laboratory. The experiments involving these Salmonella and E. coli strains were
performed in a Biosafety Level 2 Laboratory. All the procedures involving the manipulation of potentially infectious materials or cultures and the ultimate disposal were performed
according to the safe handling and containment of infectious
microorganism's regulations.
All cultures were grown in LB media at 37 ºC with shaking or on LB plate at 37 ºC till the final solution with an
OD660 of 1.0 (108 cells/mL).
Bacteria Staining and Array Hybridization
The staining and hybridization was modified according
to the following procedure. Aliquots of the bacterial cultures
were washed twice with an equal volume of PBS buffer (pH
7.4) and then were fluorescently stained with SYTO 63 red
fluorescent nucleic acid stain. Dye was added to 1 mL of bacteria suspension at a concentration of 50 nmol·L−1 in PBS
buffer and shaken for 1 h. After incubation, the bacteria sus-

HU Jing, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2020, 18(3): 219–225

pension was washed twice with 2 mL PBS buffer.
Each array was equipped with a hybridization chamber,
and then bacteria in PBS buffer that contained 1 mmol·L−1
CaCl2 and 1 mmol·L−1 MnCl2 was applied to the surface. The
arrays were gently shaken on a platform for 1 h at 27 ºC in an
2 or 8 arrays SureHyb hybridization chamber (Agilent, USA)
using the Agilent Microarray hybridization oven. After incubation, the hybridization chamber was removed, and unbound
bacteria were washed away from the array twice with a solution of the PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then
the slides were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4). A final wash with
pure water was used to remove salts from the array. Slides
were then briefly centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min to dry the
arrays. The arrays were then scanned using a fluorescent slide
reader.

Results and Discussion
The glycan ligands can be immobilized on the surface
through the various chemical approaches, resulting in their
unique spatial arrangement, which is essential for successful
fabrication of carbohydrate chips. It has been reported that
mannose with ethanolamine linker spotted onto glass slides
with the amine-reactive linker can be well used for detect
E.coli strains [24]. Similarly, we have found that mannose with
ethanolamine linker exhibited stronger binding affinity to
Salmonella strains than mannose with aromatic amine linker
by microarray, although mannosides with an aromatic aglycon have been reported to bind with FimH protein in a better
manner and thus be significant inhibitors of Type 1 fimbriaemediated bacterial adhesion [27, 29-30] The linker containing
phenyl structure may have lower rigidity and thus change the
spatial arrangement of the glycan ligands on the surface. In
order to test the detection performance, we prepared mannose and aliphatic chain linkers with different lengths and activated the glass slides into N-hydroxy-succinamide-coated
glass slides (NHS slides) and thiol-coated glass slides (SH
slides) to construct carbohydrate arrays (Fig. 1). The glass
slides (7.5 cm × 2.5 cm) were activated and fabricated according to previous reports [31-35].
To test the specificity, response sensitivity and performance of the arrays, two Salmonella enterica strains (S. galHO

maleimide linkers

linarum, ATCC9184 and S. abortusovis, ATCC31685) and
two E.coli strains (E.coli K-12 and E.coli BL-21) were used,
among which S. abortusovis ATCC316865 and E.coli K-12
have strong attach ability to mannose derivatives on eukaryotic cells surface, while S.gallinarum ATCC9184 and
E.coli BL-21 are not mannose-sensitive due to the deficiency
of the FimH protein [36].
The slides were hybridized with bacteria cells stained
with SYTOTM 63 Red fluorescent nucleic acid stain, washed
and scanned according to modified procedure [25, 35, 37] . All the
slides were first hybridized with 108 Salmonella and E. coli
bacteria cells and results (Fig. 2) show that the microspots
that contained a little longer linker (Man-H) exhibited a little
higher fluorescence intensities than that with shorter linker
(Man-E) on NHS slides with both ATCC316865 and K-12
strains. The NHS slides showed weak binding affinity for E.
coli strains.
Mannosides (Man-E and Man-H) were also probed on
thiol-activated slides (SH slides) with different linkers (L1L3) to further test the effect of linker length on the detection
performance. Interestingly, Fig. 3A and B show that the
fluorescence intensities of the microspots are related to the
length of linkers between glycans and the glass surface.
The results show the microspots of Man-E/L3 on SH-reactive slides exhibited strongest fluorescent signals.
However, the microspots probed with Man-H/L2 on SH
slides showed the stronger signals than those with Man-H-L1
and Man-H-L3. Since the linker length of Man-E on NHS
slides, Man-E-L3, Man-H-L2 on SH slides are roughly similar, it seemed that the binding efficiency of bacteria cells with
the glycans are positively correlated with the linkers length
within a certain range. The binding between the immobilized
mannose and FimH protein may be interfered when the linker
is too long, which could result unsuitable stereo-direction of
the glycans on the glass slides surface. An efficient immobilization of carbohydrates on the surface is essential for successful fabrication of carbohydrate chips. Comparing with
NHS slides, the mannosides can be more efficiently immobilized onto the slides by the coupling of thiol group and
maleimide group through the click chemistry reaction, which
then showed relatively better performance.
Thus, we chose Man-E-L3 probed SH slides for further
bacteria detection. The effect of immobilized mannosides
amount for detection was also determined. The results show
that Man-E-L3 can be probed in a less amount on SH slides to
present stronger fluorescent intensities, which are consistent
with the above binding tendencies. Since the results showed
that the immobilization of 30 mmol·L−1 mannosides didn ’t
improve the detection effect significantly compare to the immobilization of 15 mmol·L−1 mannosides, the glycan microarrays were constructed with 15 mmol·L−1 of mannosides
in the following tests. Meanwhile, the detection of E. coli
strains showed a stronger binding of K-12 strain to Man-E-L3
and Man-H-L2 coated SH slides. (Figs. 3C, D)
Different concentrations of bacteria S . ATCC316865


Detection of S. enterica and E. coli strains with NHS-activated carbohydrate microarray

were then hybridized with the Man-E-L3/SH microarrays to
determine the bacteria detection limit. The strong fluorescent
signal (signal to noise [S/N] >10) was observed when hybridized with 106 or more bacteria were incubated, and the signal
from hybridization with 104−105 cells was above background
([S/N] = 5.1−8.3). It shows the similar sensitivity as previous
report of the detection of E. coli strains [24] , which needs a
bacterial enrichment step prior to detection. In order to test
whether the bacteria strains can be detected by this mannose
microarray, over 107 cells were utilized in the following tests
for good detection effect. This detection limit may be improved by immobilization of multivalent glyco-macroligands, such as glycodendrimers [38-39], glycopolymers [40-41],
glycoliposomes [42-43] , and glyconanoparticles [23,44] to well
control the multivalence, density and orientation of the mannosides on the surface.
We then first tested the binding of several Salmonella
strains isolated from local patients on this Man-E-L3/SH microarray, including 12 Salmonella isolates in 8 seratypes,
such as S. Thomson, S. Enteritidis, S. London, S. Allerton, etc,
which are all commonly detected as foodborne bacteria in
food market [45].
It is found that most Salmonella isolates can be detected
([S/N] > 5) with the carbohydrate microarray and 9 isolates
presented very strong binding affinity ([S/N] >= 10, Table 1).

It is found this carbohydrate microarray presented positive
binding results for 8 Salmonella isolates (Table 1). Interestingly, the binding affinities of Salmonella varied with the
serotypes. Especially, S. London, S. Allerton and S. Senftenberg isolates can be detected by the microarray effectively.
The weak binding of other serovars with this mannose microarray ([S/N] <= 5) are probably due to the low binding affinity between the Salmonella serovar and monomannose
residue on the surface, for example, FimH adhesin of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium bind strongly to high-mannose
oligosaccharides [46] Furthermore, the isolates of the same
Salmonella serovar exhibited different binding affinity with
the microarray, since the same serovar also contain high- and
low-adhesive allelic variants of FimH adhesin, such as S.
Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis [47].
We further tested 9 diarrheagenic E. coli isolates from
diarrheal patients in 4 categories including enteropathogenic
E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC), which commonly cause intestinal disease and can be
detected from foods [48] ( Table 2). Although it was reported
that FimH alleles of many uropathogenic E. coli exhibit higher affinity for monomannose than most intestinal commensal
isolates, the results showed positive results of 7 E. coli isolates and very strong binding affinities of 5 isolates to the mi-

croarray indicating great potential for the detection. Recent
research revealed that the functional differences between allelic variants of Salmonella bacterial proteins, specifically
FimH adhesin, contribute to host-specific adherence [47] which
may result in the different binding pattern to mannose
residues on the glass surface. It suggested that combination of
different glycan constructions may be more helpful to detect
bacteria in diverse serovars or subtypes with different binding properties through carbohydrate microarray.

[8]

Conclusions

[12]

In summary, we have developed carbohydrate microarray using linkers of suitable length and immobilization method for the food borne bacteria detection. We tested this microarray with 12 Salmonella isolates and 9 diarrheagenic E.
coli isolates from patients for the first time and showed strong
binding with several seravars and subtypes, demonstrating
that microarrays are a powerful platform to probe the carbohydrate-pathogen interactions. The results also implied that
the microarray with single glycan construction is not enough
for the detection of bacteria with various serovars or subtypes, which contain a high degree of allelic variation in adhesin.
Future work will be focused on the microarray with combination of several suitable constructions of glycan residues
to accommodate their binding with diverse host-associated
adhesin alleles inspired by the function-structure relationship
studies of bacteria protein allelic variations with host specificity. Furthermore, the binding pattern of bacteria with different glycan ligands may be useful for the analysis of the association of binding features with the bacteria species and
serotypes.
