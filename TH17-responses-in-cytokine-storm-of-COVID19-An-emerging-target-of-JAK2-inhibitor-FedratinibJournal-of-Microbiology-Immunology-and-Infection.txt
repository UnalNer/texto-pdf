Abstract COVID-19 emerges as a pandemic disease with high mortality. Development of
effective prevention and treatment is an urgent need. We reviewed TH17 responses in patients
with SARS-CoV-2 and proposed an FDA approved JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib for reducing mortality of patients with TH17 type immune profiles.

COVID-19 (previously termed as 2019-nCoV), a novel coronavirus disease with high mortality, emerges as a pandemic
disease. As of Mar. 8, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 102
countries and caused 3584 deaths out of 105,586 confirmed
cases [WHO, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation
Report e 48]. There is no existing treatment specific for
COVID-19. Current treatments are largely symptomatic.
Development of effective prevention and treatment is an
urgent need, especially for the life-threatening severe
cases.
COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many COVID-19 patients

develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which
leads to pulmonary edema and lung failure, and have liver,
heart, and kidney damages.1,2 These symptoms are associated with a cytokine storm, manifesting elevated serum
levels of IL-1b, IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, G-CSF, GMCSF, IFNg, TNFa, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and MIP1B.1 Compared
with non-ICU patients, ICU patients have even higher levels
of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFa.1
Amongst these, several cytokines are involved in TH17
type responses. IL-1b and TNFa (TH17 and TH1 cells highly
express TNFa), both promote TH17 responses and vascular
permeability and leakage. TH17 cells themselves produce
IL-17, GM-CSF (GM-CSF is mainly associated with TH1 cells
in human), IL-21 and IL-22 (currently, there are no data on
IL-21 and IL-22). IL-17 has broad pro-inflammatory effects
on induction of cytokines G-CSF (responsible for

granulopoiesis and recruitment of neutrophils), IL-1b, IL-6,
TNFa (the latter 3 cause systemic inflammatory symptoms,
including fever); chemokines KC, MIP2A, IL-8, IP10, MIP3A
(attracting and recruiting more immune infiltrates); and
matrix metalloproteinases (participating in tissue damage
and remodeling). IL-17 (and GM-CSF) are associated with
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL-21 is required
for TH17 cell maintenance and germinal center responses in
a STAT3 dependent manner. IL-22, in collaborate with IL-17
and TNFa, is known to induce antimicrobial peptides in the
mucosal organs. In addition to antimicrobial peptides, IL-22
upregulates mucins, fibrinogen, anti-apoptotic proteins,
serum amyloid A, and LPS binding protein3; therefore, IL-22
may contribute to the formation of life-threatening edema
enriched with mucins and fibrin, seen in SARS-CoV-22 and
SARS-CoV patients.4 Xu et al. showed that peripheral blood
of a patient with severe COVID-19 had a strikingly high
number of CCR6þ TH17 cells,2 further supporting a TH17
type cytokine storm in this disease. Elevated TH17 (as well
as TH1) responses or enhanced IL-17-related pathways are
also observed in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV patients.5,6 In
MERS-CoV patients, higher IL-17 with lower IFNg and IFNa
have worse outcome than the reversed phenotype.5
Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus also induces strong TH17
(and TH1) responses.7 In a mouse model, H1N1 causes acute
lung injury in an IL-17-dependent manner.8 Taken together,
the TH17 type response contributes to the cytokine storm in
pulmonary viral infection including SARS-CoV-2, which results in tissue damage and likely promotes pulmonary
edema; targeting the TH17 pathway may benefit the patients with TH17 dominant immune profiles.
Since it will take several years to develop specific drugs
to treat COVID-19, repurposing currently marketed drugs
would provide valuable opportunities. There are several
antibody-based TH17 blockades (anti-IL-17, anti-IL-17R and
anti-IL-12/23p40) available; however, the antibody-based
treatment is expensive and has only a narrow spectrum of
effects. Several RORgt (and RORa) inhibitors currently on
clinic trials would be promising TH17 blockers in a near
future. Here, we propose an alternative method to inhibit
TH17 responses.
STAT3, a transcription factor, mediates IL-6 and IL-23
signals for TH17 cell initial differentiation and effector
function. Both IL-6 and IL-23 activate STAT3 through JAK2
(IL-6 also uses JAK1),9 whereas IL-21 activates STAT3 (and
STAT1 and STAT5) through JAK1 and JAK3. We postulate
that JAK2 inhibitors can be used to restrict the proinflammatory function of existing TH17 cells. In addition to
JAK2 inhibitors, several FDA approved STAT3 inhibitors are
also promising but may affect IL-21 signals in B cells. Type I
interferons are important in anti-viral immunity, but type I
interferons employ JAK1 and TYK2 to activate STAT1 and
STAT2. Therefore, specific JAK2 inhibitors would not disrupt
the signals of type I interferons.
We tested Fedratinib (SAR302503, TG101348), a JAK2
inhibitor approved by FDA for myeloproliferative neoplasms, on TH17 cell cytokine production. Fedratinib is
specific for JAK2 but does not affect JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2.
We found that Fedratinib treatment decreased the
expression of IL-17 by murine TH17 cells, and this suppressive effect was even more profound when IL-23 was
added (Fig. 1). In addition, Fedratinib also inhibited the

TH17 cells. In vitro differentiated TH17 cells were activated
with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and treated with or
without IL-23 in the presence of 2 mM Fedratinib (Fedr) or a
vehicle (saline) for 4 h. The results were normalized to an internal control Actb and the vehicle treatment was set as 1.

expression of IL-22 by TH17 cells (Fig. 1). Besides, Fedratinib only has marginal effects on IL-21 expression (Fig. 1),
suggesting that Fedratinib does not compromise IL-21
mediated B cell function. In addition, GM-CSF also uses
JAK2 to transduce signals; therefore, JAK2 inhibitor would
also suppress GM-CSF function. In a murine model of multiple sclerosis, a TH17 and TH1-driven autoimmune brain
disease, subcutaneous administration of JAK2 inhibitor
tyrphostin B42, during the disease induction, greatly
decreased the disease severity.10 In summary, JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib can suppress the production of several TH17
signature cytokines (and likely also the effects of IL-6 on
other types of cells), therefore promising to prevent the
deteriorating outcomes of TH17 associated cytokine storm
in COVID-19 and other severe viral infections. The JAK2
inhibitor can also be used in combination of anti-viral drugs
and supportive treatments. Because JAK2 inhibition is
reversible, transient treatment with this inhibitor before
the disease transition from serious to critical or during the
critical phase would not affect TH17 responses essential for
innate immune responses and immunity against extracellular pathogens.
