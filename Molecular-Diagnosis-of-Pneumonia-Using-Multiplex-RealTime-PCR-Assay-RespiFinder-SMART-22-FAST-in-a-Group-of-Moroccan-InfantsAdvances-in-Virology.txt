Background. In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the ﬁrst cause of
mortality due to infectious diseases. The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is diﬃcult. Therefore, it is
necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identiﬁcation.
Objectives. In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular
diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with
systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the
multiplex RespiFinder SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. Results. Of the 86 infants considered
in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple
viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A
and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), inﬂuenza A (3%), inﬂuenza H1N1
(1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainﬂuenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections
were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. Conclusion. The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and
often nonspeciﬁc. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase
chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal ﬂora,
and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
pneumonia is deﬁned as acute respiratory tract infections
(RTIs) which aﬀect the lungs tissue (bronchi, bronchioles,
and alveolar tissue) [1]. In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia

remains a serious public health problem and constitutes the
ﬁrst cause of mortality due to infectious diseases [2].
Pneumonia is a major cause of childhood morbidity and
mortality worldwide. The WHO estimates that the 1.4
million children who die annually are under 5 years of age,
where the greatest risk of death is in the neonatal period [3].

2
The epidemiology and etiology of pneumonia vary from
country to country and from region to region. In developing
countries, the incidence of pneumonia among children
under 5 years of age is 0.29 episodes per child/year, compared to 0.05 episodes per child/year in developed countries
[4, 5].
Pneumonia is caused by a variety of microorganisms
(viruses, bacteria, or fungi). Viruses are the most common
causative agents for children under 5 years of age, especially
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), inﬂuenza
(IV), parainﬂuenza viruses (PIV), and adenovirus (ADV)
[6, 7]. At least 26 viruses have now been associated with
pneumonia. Their distribution varies by season, geographic
region, and age group (4). Considering the frequency of viral
infection, antibacterial therapy is often employed inadequately and unnecessarily [8].
The etiological diagnosis of pneumonia is diﬃcult, due to
the similarity in clinical presentation and also due to the
overlap of the symptoms between viruses and bacteria, or
between diﬀerent viruses [9]. For this reason, the use of
Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays
tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identiﬁcation
appears to be necessary. They detect a wide range of viral and
bacterial pathogens simultaneously in a single reaction, with
higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity in hours [10].
The aim of this study is to present the clinical results of
pediatric pneumonia and describing their epidemiology and
etiology among infants who live in Morocco and admitted to
a neonatology unit.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Design and Population of the Study. This prospective
study was conducted from December 1, 2016, to May 31,
2018, at the National Reference Center for Neonatology and
Nutrition and Medical Research Laboratory at Children’s
Hospital of Rabat. We included in this study 86 infants
admitted with respiratory distress isolated or associated with
systemic signs.
2.2. Inclusion Criteria. Infants, regardless of their gestational
age or geographical origin, whose actual age was less than 4
months, hospitalized for suspicion of pneumonia.
Inclusion criteria were based on diagnosis by clinical
symptoms (respiratory symptoms). The infants were
recruited if they presented with symptoms associated with
the WHO’s deﬁnition of clinical pneumonia. They are deﬁned as having a history of cough, raised respiratory rate, or
chest wall indrawing [2, 11].

clinical evaluation of patient, as well as information regarding the patient’s family members.
The studied data are as follows:
(i) Epidemiological data: age, sex, and socioeconomic
status
(ii) Environment of the patient, home conditions, and
health history
(iii) Clinical data: symptoms and evolution
(iv) Paraclinical data: biological analysis (complete
blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), RT-PCR),
chest X-rays (interpreted by pediatricians)
2.5. Collected Samples. The tracheal secretion (TS) samples
were collected in the ﬁrst 12 hours of hospitalization and
transferred from the neonatology department to the medical
research laboratory at Children’s Hospital in Rabat.
The collection of TS was performed according to the
standard procedure, that is, by using a tracheal aspiration
probe. This was introduced until resistance was encountered
and retracted by approximately 2 cm. This was followed by
the release of the vacuum, and the probe was delicately
removed using turning movements, from which the secretion was aspirated into a sterile collector tube.
2.6. Laboratory Methods. The samples were analyzed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions by using the
RespiFinder SMART 22 FAST. This assay can detect and
diﬀerentiate simultaneously 22 respiratory pathogens: 18
viruses (inﬂuenza viruses A and B, inﬂuenza virus A H1N1,
respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A and B, parainﬂuenza
viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus (RV)/enterovirus, coronaviruses (Cor) (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), human
metapneumovirus (hMPV)), adenovirus (ADV), bocavirus
(BoV), and 4 bacteria (Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella
pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila
pneumoniae) [12].
175 μl of TS samples were eluted in 40 μl of elution
buﬀer. The assays comprised a preampliﬁcation step, which
combines reverse transcriptase and multiplex target ampliﬁcation PCR, followed by a probe hybridization step, a
probe ligation step, and a probe ampliﬁcation step. The
Internal Ampliﬁcation Control (IAC) was added at the
beginning of the procedure to diﬀerentiate between samples
with true-negative results and samples with false- negative
results due to PCR failure. Targets are detected using capillary electrophoresis [13].

2.3. Exclusion Criteria. All newborns aged between 0 and 9
days and infants with transient respiratory distress or respiratory distress of cardiac, neurological, or malformative
origin, were excluded from this study.

2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
with the Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS.18) and
analyzed by using the software RChi2 of Pearson. A p value
<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

2.4. Data Collection. All data were entered into sheet containing epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical data, and

2.8. Ethical Consideration. The parents of all participants have
given informed written consent. The protocol of the study was

3. Results
The subjects of this study were a total of the 86 infants. They
presented with respiratory symptoms and suspicion of pneumonia. Among them, 46 (53%) were male and 40 (47%) were
female, and the sex ratio was 1.15. The mean age was 31 ± 19
days. 54% of the patients were of middle socioeconomic status,
45% had low socioeconomic status, while only one of them was
of a high socioeconomic status. According to the parents, 4 (5%)
families had a pet at home, 44 (51%) had dampness at home,
and 11 (13%) had lived with smokers (Table 1).
All patients included in this study were conscious and had at
least one respiratory symptom with a high frequency of dyspnea,
representing 95% of the cases. Cough, rhinorrhea, and fever
were frequent with 67%, 62%, and 38%, respectively (Table 2).
84% of our patients performed chest X-ray , where 62% were
abnormal. 91% of the cases with abnormal chest X-rays results
showed a conﬁrmed infection (p < 0.004) using the RT-PCR
technique (Table 3). Mean duration of hospitalization was 6 ± 5
days; the length of stay of the dead infants was not included, and
it was 10 ± 4 days. During this period, 3% of deaths and 10% of
complications by nosocomial infection were detected.
The results of multiplex RT-PCR showed the presence of 7
types of viruses and one species of bacteria. At least, one
pathogen was detected in 71/86 of the samples (83%). The most
prevalent virus was RSV, detected in 46/86 of the samples
(51%), where type A and B represented 59% and 41%, respectively. In the total of the samples, IV A represented 4%

whose one patients had a subtype of IV H1N1, RV was detected
in 20/86 (23%) of samples, ADV was detected in 2/86 (2%) of
samples, Cor229E in 10/86 (12%) of samples, hMPV was
detected in 5/86 (6%) samples, and PIV4 was detected in 2/86
(2%) of samples. 6% of the patients had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfection was seen in 22 specimens representing
26% of all samples (22/86) and 31% of positive samples (22/71).
In the case of co-infection with two viruses, 19 samples were
positive. Coinfection virus/bacteria were detected in 4 cases.
The most frequently detected coinfection combinations were
RSV/rhino (n � 7) and RSV/Cor229E (n � 6) (Table 4).
According to our study, the seasonality distribution of
viruses varies, the graphic shows that viral infections are
essentially present in the coldest season (autumn and
winter), when the seasonality of some respiratory viruses is
not well established. RSV A and B were the most prevalent
viruses; they appeared frequently in September and December. The cases with IV A were detected in January,
February, and July; inﬂuenza H1N1 was detected in February. Cor229E was most predominant in May. RV was
detected during the study without any pick. The other viruses hMPV, ADV, and PIV4 were less frequent (Figure 1).
We compared the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics between the positive (83%) and negative
samples (17%). The proportion of positives in males was 62%
(44/71, p < 0.001). The rate of prematurity presented 64.3% in
the positives cases (p < 0.04). For the rest of the general
characteristics (including age, socioeconomic status, and environment of the patient), the comparison between the two
groups does not show any signiﬁcance (Table 1). Most clinical
signs and symptoms were present in both groups, with a higher

biology. The current molecular methods can detect a large
panel of viruses, and bacteria also can make the etiological
diagnosis more eﬃcient, in contrast to traditional methods
which are less sensitive and most of which are not suitable
for rapid diagnosis [17–19]. At Children’s Hospital in Rabat
CHR, RTIs are frequent, especially the acute lower RTIs;
they represented a large proportion of all-cause consultations [2]. Therefore, their precise diagnosis is necessary [19].
Currently, a large variety of molecular assays was developed
and commercialized [20]. Ruuskanen et al. reported that the
evidence of viral infection is present in 49% of pediatric cases
using molecular diagnostics [4, 21].

clinically suspected pneumonia. A very high percentage of
our samples were positive (83%). The majority of our patients had viral infections. Additionally, most viruses in the
test panel were detected (RSV, RV, Cor 229E, hMPV, IVA,
IV A H1N1, ADV, and PIV4). Dabisch-Ruthe et al. reported
that there is a higher clinical sensitivity of the RespiFinder19 in the detection of virus. They found Respiratory viruses
in 64% of the Tracheal secretion (TS) samples [12]. This high
positivity is similar to other studies in which molecular
methods were performed [2, 22–24].
In this study, the most prevalent pathogen was RSV A/B.
It was detected in 53% of samples. According to several
studies, RSV (A and B) is known as the most common cause
of pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide [25].
Hall CB et al. suggest that RSV has the greatest disease
burden both in hospitalized children and in outpatients,
especially in children under 5 years of age [26]. This higher
proportion in infants is due to maternal antibodies that are
ineﬀective in preventing RSV infections [24]. A systematic
review realized by Shi et al. in 2015 estimated that 30 million
episodes of acute lower respiratory infection caused by RSV
were about a third in the ﬁrst year of the life among children
aged less than 4 years in low-income and middle-income
countries. They also estimated 2.8 million episodes in highincome countries [27]. The second virus detected in the
study was RV with 23%. The human RV is the most frequent
causative agents of both upper and lower respiratory tract
infections and the main causative agents of the common
cold. It causes severe ARIs in infants and young children

6
[28, 29]. ADV was detected in 2% of cases; it is one of the
major causes of lower respiratory tract infection in children
aged more than 2 years and in adults, but rarely in
newborns and infants [30]. Inﬂuenza A accounted for 4%
of virus-detection-positive samples. According to the
results of a study published in Morocco by Ezzine et al.
during both seasons (2016/2017-2017/2018), inﬂuenza
infections in ARIs cases aﬀects especially adults aged more
than 65 years (20.7%) and children aged between 5 and 15
years (36%), while children aged less than two years had a
low rate (4.4%) [31]. The IV is known for its seasonal
outbreaks of ARI during a few weeks in winter [29].
According to a study realized in Brazil by Canela et al.,
among children aged between 0 and 18 years, the virus
positivity is higher with frequency of IV H1N1 (38%) [32].
PIV subtype 4 was detected in 2% of our cases, and it has
been reported to be a much less frequent cause of ARIs
[33]. The group of coronavirus is heterogeneous (HCoV
229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) [34]. In our study, we
detected only Cor229E. The clinical symptoms of coronavirus and other newly discovered viruses involved in
RTIs (human bocavirus and hMPV) are similar to the
other respiratory viruses and are recognized frequently at
young age [13]. Our results are similar to those of other
studies conducted among children and infants [35, 36].
Our etiological results coincide with those of a study
realized at Toulouze University Hospital among children
suﬀering from ARIs; there samples were analyzed using
the RespiFinder 15 assay, the prevalence of virus was
88.7% and the RSV was the most frequently detected
39.5% [9]. Regarding bacteria, only 6% of our patients had
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while 81% of the cases have
been treated with antibiotic. The low prevalence of bacteria may be explained by the use of antibiotics as an
urgent act used in cases suspected with ARTs. Beckmann
and Hirsch detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2.1%
among pediatric and adult patients [36].
According to several studies, the incidence of coinfections depends on diﬀerent populations and test panels
[37]. Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al. reported that the
molecular assays revealed a high frequency of double
infections. Speciﬁcally, coronaviruses (75%), RSV (58%),
and RV (46%) were frequently detected as mixed infection
[8]. The current study shows coinfection in 31% of positive
samples, with a high frequency in the combinations between RSV/rhino and RSV/Cor229E. Several studies had
pointed out that clinical severity is associated with
coinfection with more than one virus [8, 37, 38]. Another
study reported that coinfection was not associated with an
increase in the clinical severity [39]. Our results did not
show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in clinical severity between
coinfection and single infection. Also, clinical presentation of diﬀerent causative agents was often similar. The
association of viral detection with clinical characteristics
shows a predominance of respiratory signs specially
(dyspnea, polypnea, cyanosis, labored breathing, wheezing, and Rhonch). Our clinical symptoms and signs
concurred with those of the study realized by Singh S et al.
among infants aged less than 2 months [40].

5. Conclusion
The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex
and often nonspeciﬁc. Therefore early and rapid detection of
related causative agents is crucial. Multiplex RT-PCR assays
for respiratory infections are not used in routine diagnosis in
Morocco. Their use in the near future may help pediatricians
choose an appropriate treatment, reduce the overall use of
unnecessary antibiotics, stop their use in patients infected
with virus, initiate antiviral therapy and preserve intestinal
ﬂora, and help to decrease nosocomial infection by reducing
the length of hospitalization, which would also decrease
management costs. Multiplex RT-PCR assays for respiratory
infections are likely to be the subject of future studies on
larger samples and diﬀerent age groups.
