Background. In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the ﬁrst cause of
mortality due to infectious diseases. The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is diﬃcult. Therefore, it is
necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identiﬁcation.
Objectives. In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular
diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with
systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the
multiplex RespiFinder SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. Results. Of the 86 infants considered
in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple
viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A
and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), inﬂuenza A (3%), inﬂuenza H1N1
(1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainﬂuenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections
were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. Conclusion. The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and
often nonspeciﬁc. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase
chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal ﬂora,
and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.
