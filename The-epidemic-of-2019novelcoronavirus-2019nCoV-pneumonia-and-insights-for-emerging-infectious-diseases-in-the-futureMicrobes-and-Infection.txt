At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia
spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to
public health and attracted enormous attention around the world. To date, there are no clinically
approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research
on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of
transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote
the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the
epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including
tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate
on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was detected in pneumonia patients which was later named 2019-nCoV. Since the ﬁrst
human coronavirus detected in the 1960s, 2019-nCoV is the seventh coronavirus that is known to infect humans [1]. Among all the
human coronaviruses, four of them, including NL-63, 229E, HKU1
and OC43, cause mild illness, while the other three, SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, lead to serious disease [2]. To characterize the new pathogen causing acute infection in humans, researchers have conducted urgent studies on the 2019-nCoV, from
its epidemiology and clinical medicine to etiology and virology. This
review focuses on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of
2019-nCoV, the diagnosis and treatment of infected patients, and in
particular, evidence regarding the origin of 2019-nCoV.

1. Emergence and epidemic of pneumonias caused by 2019nCoV
1.1. Pathogen identiﬁcation and transmission of pneumonia
On 31th December 2019, the ﬁrst pneumonia case of unknown
etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. In
order to identify the etiology, a number of possible etiological
agents were ruled out, including the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), avian inﬂuenza virus, and other
common respiratory pathogens. Finally, a new coronavirus,
temporally named 2019-nCoV, was identiﬁed to be the pathogen
responsible for disease, and it was announced by World Health
Organization (WHO) on 12th January [3]. As of January 11, 2020, 41
pneumonia cases were diagnosed, including seven severe cases and
one death [2]. At that time, there was no evidence of person-toperson transmission according to the scientiﬁc literature. The ﬁrst
“super-spreading” event became a hallmark of the epidemiology of
the disease. On January 20, 2020, in epidemiological investigations,
two local infections in patients who were infected by 2019-nCoV
without physical visits to Wuhan were reported in Guangdong
Province, which conﬁrmed the occurrence of human-to-human

The Health Commission of Hubei province, China, ﬁrst announced a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia.
A total of 44 patients (11 are severely ill, while the remaining 33 patients are in stable condition.) with pneumonia of unknown etiology have
been reported to WHO by the national authorities in China.
The WHO published a document detailing 44 patients had “pneumonia of unknown etiology”, with 121 close contacts under surveillance.
The genetic sequencing demonstrated that the novel coronavirus is the potential causative organism.
41 patients have been diagnosed to have infection of the novel coronavirus, with 763 close contacts, 7 severe cases and the ﬁrst death.
The virus was tentatively named by WHO as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
The ﬁrst imported case of 2019-nCoV was found in Thailand. This is the ﬁrst infected person diagnosed outside China. The patient is a 61year-old Chinese woman living in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
The ﬁrst case reported in Japan. This is the second conﬁrmed case of 2019-nCoV that has been detected outside of China. The person travelled
to Wuhan, China.
The ﬁrst case reported in Korea. The patient was a Chinese woman who ﬂew from Wuhan to Incheon International Airport. Four other
suspected patients were being examined. Furthermore, the ﬁrst case reported in Shenzhen, China.
Two local infections in the Chinese province of Guangdong with no direct visit to Wuhan were the ﬁrst conﬁrmed the occurrence of humanto-human transmission through epidemiological investigation. And the ﬁrst case reported in Shanghai, China.
15 health-care workers infected with the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan. Zhejiang Province, Henan Province, Sichuan Province and Taiwa conﬁrmed
the ﬁrst case of 2019-nCoV, respectively. The WHO announced that there was possible sustained human to-human transmission.
17 death in Hubei Province. America and Macao and Many provinces conﬁrmed the ﬁrst case of 2019-nCoV. Such as Shandong Province,
Yunnan Province, Hunan Province, America, Macao, Anhui Province, Fujian Province, Guizhou Province, Shanxi Province, Ningxia
Autonomous Region and Hebei Province reported the ﬁrst case of 2019-nCoV, respectively.
the local government in Wuhan announced the suspension of public transportation, with closure of airports, railway stations, and highways
Zhejiang and Shanghai’s ﬁrst patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV recover.
The conﬁrmed pneumonia cases are increasing in 34 provinces, municipalities, and special administrative regions in China. 24,377 cases of
2019-nCoV conﬁrmed in China, including 492 deaths, 3219 serious, and 901 cured. 175 cases of infection were conﬁrmed in 24 other cities
around the world.

transmission [4]. Then, 14 medical staff infected by 2019-nCoV from
patients further conﬁrmed the human-to-human contagion [5]. On
21th January 2020, WHO announced that 2019-nCoV was possibly
sustained through human-to-human transmission, warning the
public to take self-protection measures [3]. The ﬁrst of many cases,
this disease was rapidly shown to cause an epidemic [6]. Due to the
high transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, the Chinese government has
taken quick action and various measures to deal with the epidemic,
trying to prevent spread of the outbreak and to treat patients. Researchers put much effort to understand the origin and pathophysiology of this novel coronavirus, and have been testing
multiple drugs to screen effective therapy.

1.2. Current situation of the epidemic
Until February 6, 2020, conﬁrmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases
were increasing with worrisome speed in China. As of 5th February,
there were 24,377 cases conﬁrmed in mainland China, including
492 deaths, 3219 severe cases, and 901 cured cases [6]. The fatality
rate was about 2%. In addition, 175 cases of 2019-nCoV infection
were conﬁrmed in 24 other countries around the world. The typical
events during the 2019-nCoV outbreak are summarized in Table 1.
The period from the end of December 2019 to January 2020 was the
“Spring Festival travel rush” time in China. Although the government issued an order to control the ﬂow of people, the disease

2. Epidemiological and clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV

scans [4,17,18]. However, patients with 2019-nCoV infection rarely
have obvious upper respiratory signs and symptoms (such as snot,
sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the virus primarily infects
the lower respiratory tract [4,17]. In addition, about 20e25% of
2019-nCoV patients experience intestinal symptoms and signs
(such as diarrhea), similarly to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [17]. In severe 2019-nCoV infection cases, the symptoms include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and
bleeding and coagulation dysfunction. It is worth noting that severe
and critically ill patients may have moderate to low fever during the
course of the disease, even without obvious fever [3]. Furthermore,
like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV infections induce production of high levels of cytokines [2,17].
The epidemic of 2019-nCoV bears some similarities to SARSCoV. The outbreaks of the two viruses occurred at about the same
time during the year, and they were quite stable in the environment, especially in air-conditioned space, owing to lower ambient
temperature and lower humidity [19]. However, SARS-CoV had an
aberrant trait that the “viral load” in upper respiratory tract secretions was low in the ﬁrst 5 days of illness, then increased progressively and peaked early in the second week. Consequently, the
transmission rate was relatively low in the ﬁrst days of illness,
providing an opportunity for case detection and isolation to interrupt transmission. On the contrary, for 2019-nCoV, the incubation
lasts for an average of 10 days (in a reported range of 2e14 days)
from infection to symptoms surfacing [2,4,17,20]. Even worse, 2019nCoV is able to spread from one person to another even before any
actual clinical manifestations, leading to “extremely challenging”
conditions for detecting and isolating potential patients, which
makes it more difﬁcult to control the epidemic.

2.1. Human coronaviruses

2.3. Transmission routes of the disease

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) could cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous system diseases. Infection
outcomes vary from mild, self-limiting disease, to more severe
manifestations and even death [1,11]. Among the seven human
CoVs, two a-coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and two
b-coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) were thought to
cause only mild self-limiting upper respiratory disease, such as
common cold in immunocompetent hosts, except for a few cases of
severe infections in infants, children and seniors [12,13]; the other
three CoVs could cause fatal respiratory diseases. In 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in
Guangdong province, China, spreading to 37 countries, and its
subsequent global epidemic was associated with 8096 cases and
774 deaths. Ten years later, Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spread to 27 countries, causing 2494 infected
cases and 858 deaths worldwide [1]. And the recently identiﬁed
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was the third highly pathogenic
CoV discovered, with a mortality of 2% which is much lower than
that of SARS-CoV (10%) and MERS-CoV (37%) [6]. However, the
transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is higher, the mean R0 (R0 is used to
estimate the transmissibility of virus) of 2019-nCoV ranged from
3.3 to 5.5, and it appeared (slightly) higher than those of SARS-CoV
(2e5) and MERS-CoV (2.7e3.9) [14e16]. Measures on ‘entry, exit
and travel’ screening and restrictions are likely to reduce the
effective R0, which should beneﬁt 2019-nCoV control and
prevention.

2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through droplets, close
contact, aerosol and maybe fecal-oral transmission, and patients in
the incubation period can transmit the virus to other persons [5].
The distribution of the viral receptor can explain the pathogenic
mechanisms, clinical manifestations and transmission routes of
2019-nCoV [20,21]. ACE2, a receptor for 2019-nCoV, is necessary for
the viral entry of 2019-nCoV. The ubiquitous expression of ACE2 in
various cells, such as lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper, stratiﬁed
epithelial cells, and absorptive enterocytes of ileum and colon may
contribute to the multi-tissue infection of 2019-nCoV [22]. Therefore, besides respiratory and bodily contact, fecal-oral transmission
is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection [23,24].

spread rapidly to other cities because of asymptomatic carriers
[7e9].
1.3. Preventive measures
To deal with the 2019-nCoV epidemic, the central and local
governments of China took a series of drastic measures. First of all,
Chinese health authorities conducted an immediate investigation
to characterize and control the disease, including isolation of suspected patients, monitoring of contact clinical status of patients,
and developing diagnostic and treatment procedures [5]. In addition, on January 23, 2020, the local government of Wuhan
announced the suspension of public transportation, closing airports, railway stations, and highways in the city, in order to prevent
further disease transmission [10]. Subsequently, most provinces in
China claimed “Level I Emergency Response” by taking a series of
measures such as suspending public transportation and setting up
community quarantines. Particularly, the list of the ﬁrst-level
designated hospitals was announced, and epidemic prevention
training for primary medical staff was started. Since fever is one of
typical clinical symptoms of the infection, temperature detection of
incoming and outgoing personnel was implemented comprehensively in railway stations, passenger stations and other public places, in order to screen suspected cases as early as possible. In
addition, many other compulsory measures limiting population
mobility, such as cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures,
work-from-home arrangements, was taken to reduce withinpopulation contact rates.

2.2. Clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection
The clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection are similar to
those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Most patients present fever, dry
cough, dyspnea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT

3. Biological features and origin of the 2019-nCoV
3.1. Genomics of 2019-nCoV
According to the genome analysis, 2019-nCoV belongs to Sarbecovirus subgenus, Betacoronavirus genus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae of the suborder
cornidovirineae of the order Nidovirales [20,26]. Similarly to other
coronaviruses, 2019-nCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA (þssRNA) with around 29,900 nt, showing a typical
coronavirus appearance under electron microscopy [20]. The
genome organization is 50 -leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)-E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-30 UTRpoly (A) tail with
accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes and the 30
end of the genome [26].
2019-nCoV shares 79.5% nt identity with SARS-CoV and 96%
identity with bat-CoV-RaTG13 [20]. The genetic characteristics of
2019-nCoV are signiﬁcantly different from SARSr-CoV and SARSCoV, which are closely related only to the speciﬁc bat SARS-like

coronaviruses, bat-CoV-RaTG13 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, with 96%
and 86.9% nucleotide sequence identities, respectively [20].
Therefore 2019-nCoV is considered as a SARS related coronavirus
(SARSr-CoV) by pairwise protein sequence analysis (Fig. 1) [20].
3.2. Receptor usage of 2019-nCoV
The prerequisite of coronaviruses invading the host-cell is to
bind to receptors. Following receptor binding, the viral spike
protein is cleaved via acid-dependent proteolysis by cathepsin,
TMPRRS2 or furin protease, followed by fusion of the viral envelop
to the cellular membranes. Spike is a large, clove-shaped trimer,
which can be cleaved by proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit
containing the receptor binding domain (RBD) and a C-terminal
S2 region. Compared to other proteins of coronavirus, the spike
protein has the most variable amino acid sequences which results
from the strongest positive selection among all genes of coronavirus to adapt to its hosts [27].The RBD is a major determinant of
host range and cross-species transmission. Recently results
showed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2,
as SARS-CoV [21,24,20,28]. Besides human ACE2, 2019-nCoV can
use Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, or pig ACE2 but not mouse ACE2
as an entry receptor [24]. One explanation is that human ACE2 has
high homology with Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, pig and mouse,
which are 80.75%, 83.48%, 81.37%, 82.11% respectively (Table 2),
while the residues 82 and 353 of mouse ACE2 are different from
human ACE2 which are important residues for bind to spike [29].
But the homology of human ACE2 and pangolin ACE2, cat ACE2 are
also high with 84.84% and 85.22%. The homology of human ACE2
with other ACE2 varies from 59.73% to 83.23%. In summary, 2019nCoV may have extensive host ranges. Fig. 2.
3.3. Origin of 2019-nCoV
The epidemiological investigation of early cases of 2019-nCoV
pneumonia showed that many cases had been exposed to the
Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [2,24,20]. In addition, 33 of the
585 environmental samples from Huanan Seafood Market were
positive for 2019-nCoV; however, that market was trading a variety of live animals, such as hedgehog, badger, snake, and bird
(turtledoves), probably pangolin, but not bats [24,30]. Thus, bats
are less likely to have direct contact with human, and direct
transmission of the virus from bat to human is unlikely [1].
Indeed, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, the natural reservoir, but transmitted to humans via intermediate host
civets and camels, respectively. Therefore, 2019-nCoV may also
originate from bat but was then transmitted to humans via an
intermediate host in the market [31e35]. Currently, 2019-nCoV
has been isolated from pangolins and it was found that the
genomic seuqence of the isolated strain had 99% identity with that
of currently 2019-nCoV infected humans. It has been proposed
that the transmission and evolution path of 2019-nCoV was from
bat-CoV to pangolins (the intermediate hosts), from where it
infected humans [36].
4. Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis of coronaviruses is unnecessary in most cases of selflimited infection, as most of the patients have mild or moderate
syndromes with good prognosis. However, it may be essential to
identify an etiological agent in epidemiological studies, especially
during the epidemics outbreak. Since 2019-nCoV has not been
found before in humans, there is no vaccine or special treatment
for it so far. The number of cases is increasing rapidly, even under
the current public health emergency. Thus, diagnosing all

other animals by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with 1000 bootstrap. The accession numbers were as the same as Table 2. Bootstrap values above 50 were shown.

suspected cases as soon as possible and immediately isolating them
is critical to cutting off the source of infection. Conventional diagnostic testing methods, such as the assays for detection of antiviral
antibodies or viral antigens have been developed and used clinically. New diagnostic strategies including multiplex nucleic acid
ampliﬁcation and microarray-based assays may help in epidemiologic monitoring, along with taking effective prevention steps
[37,38]. 2019-nCoV nucleic acids can be detected in specimens
including nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract
secretions, blood and stool [20].
There are currently no approved antiviral treatments or vaccines
for human coronavirus infections. The development of safe, stable
vaccines is a huge challenge and vaccines would ideally be broadspectrum, so the research and development of new drugs is a
very long process. In such a sudden epidemic, scientists were not
able to carry out new drug development by the traditional principles. Therefore, there is another option: a systematic and largescale screening of existing drugs to see whether they have activity against the 2019-nCoV. Recently drug screening found that
nelﬁnavir has potential antiviral activity against 2019-nCoV. In
addition, pitavastatin, perampanel, and praziquantel might also
have moderate activities against 2019-nCoV [39]. Based on previous
studies, an anti-HIV drug named Kaletra may have therapeutic effect on SARS and MERS, which is composed of two protease inhibitors, ritonavir (CAS#: 155,213-67-5) and lopinavir (CAS#:
192,725-17-0) [40e44]. More recently, Kaletra was also recommended to treat Wuhan pneumonia by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Patients with SARS or
MERS have used several drugs including ribavirin, interferon,
lopinavir-ritonavir, and corticosteroids, but the efﬁcacy of certain
drugs is still controversial. Other antiviral drugs, like FAD-approved
drugs including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitrazine, nalfamusta,

chloroquine, and the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs redexivir
(GS-5734) and favivir (T-705), are being evaluated by measuring
the effects of these compounds on cytotoxicity, virus yield and
infection rate of 2019-nCoV. Recent results showed that remdesivir
and chloroquine are effective in controlling 2019-nCoV infection
in vitro and may be evaluated in human patients with 2019-nCoV
disease [45]. Remdesivir has recently been recognized as a promising antiviral drug against multiple RNA viruses (including SARS/
MERS-CoV) in cultured cells, and in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models. Currently remdesivir for the treatment of
Ebola virus infection is in clinical research. It is promising that these
compounds can treat 2019-nCoV infections. Moreover, the ﬁfth
edition of infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance
announced that severe and critically ill patients could be treated
with recovery plasma.
5. Conclusions and future perspectives
The 2019-nCoV epidemic continues. During the past month,
huge progress has been made in pathogen monitoring, identifying
sources, basic etiology, clinical treatment, drug testing, and vaccine
development. With the efforts of China and the helps of other
countries in the world, we hope that the epidemic will subside
soon. Future research on viral replication, pathogenesis, antiviral
drugs and other aspects of 2019-nCoV will contribute to the
treatment and prevention of the virus. However, given the emergence of 2019-nCoV pneumonia as a new infectious disease with
interspecies transmission from animals, we should reﬂect on the
origin of the human pathogen and learn from our experience. With
changes of ecology and human activities, including unlimited invasion of natural habitats of animals, consumption of some of these
animals, and modern agricultural practices, the spillover of viruses

J.-Y. Li et al. / Microbes and Infection 22 (2020) 80e85

from natural hosts to humans continues to appear and may even be
escalating. Although we have built an unparalleled human civilization and a highly developed information society, invisible viruses
can still have devastating effects on human beings. The high
lethality viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H5N1, H7N9, Ebola
and emerging 2019-nCoV should serve as an alarm to the world. We
should strive to reduce the probability of their occurrence and
harm. Strengthening the investigation of animal etiology, normalizing the storage of high risk pathogens, reducing direct contact
with wildlife, maintaining the barriers between natural reservoirs
and human society and completely eradicating wildlife trading will
help to achieve these goals.
