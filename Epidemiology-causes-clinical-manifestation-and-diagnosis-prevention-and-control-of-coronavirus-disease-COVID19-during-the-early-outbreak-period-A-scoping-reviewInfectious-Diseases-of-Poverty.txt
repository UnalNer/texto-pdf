Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory
illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had
spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has
declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and
O’Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed
to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research
domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors’ affiliations, and methodological characteristics were
included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on
published information as listed in the references.
Results: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of
published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars.
Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to
prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus’ origination is in connection to a seafood market
in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough,
fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand
hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been
discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence,
infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.

Conclusions: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early
period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well
as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current
public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of
public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.
Keywords: COVID-19, Epidemiology, Causes, Prevention and control, Review

Background
The coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that may
cause various symptoms such as pneumonia, fever,
breathing difficulty, and lung infection [1]. These viruses
are common in animals worldwide, but very few cases
have been known to affect humans. The World Health
Organization (WHO) used the term 2019 novel coronavirus to refer to a coronavirus that affected the lower respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan,
China on 29 December 2019 [2–4]. The WHO announced that the official name of the 2019 novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [4]. And the
current reference name for the virus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was
reported that a cluster of patients with pneumonia of
unknown cause was linked to a local Huanan South
China Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
in December 2019 [5].
In response to the outbreak, the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) dispatched
a rapid response team to accompany health authorities
of Hubei province and Wuhan city to conduct epidemiological and etiological investigations. The WHO confirmed that the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic
was associated with the Huanan South China Seafood
Marketplace, but no specific animal association was
identified [6]. Scientists immediately started to research
the source of the new coronavirus, and the first genome
of COVID-19 was published by the research team led by
Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang, on 10 January 2020 [7]. Within
1 month, this virus spread quickly throughout China
during the Chinese New Year – a period when there is a
high level of human mobility among Chinese people. Although it is still too early to predict susceptible populations, early patterns have shown a trend similar to
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Susceptibility seems to be associated with age, biological
sex, and other health conditions [8]. COVID-19 has now
been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO [9].
Given the spread of the new coronavirus and its impacts
on human health, the research community has responded
rapidly to the new virus and many preliminary research

articles have already been published about this epidemic
(Additional file 1). We conducted a scoping review to
summarize and critically analyze all the published scientific articles regarding the new coronavirus in January
2020. This review aims to provide the evidence of early
findings on the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, as
well as prevention and control of COVID-19 in relation to
time, location, and source of publication. This review can
provide meaningful information for future research related
to this topic and may support government decisionmaking on strategies to handle this public health emergency at the community, national, and international levels.

Methods
Study design

A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley
[10]. The following five steps were followed to conduct
this scoping review: a) identifying a clear research objective and search strategies, b) identifying relevant research articles, c) selection of research articles, d)
extraction and charting of data, and e) summarizing, discussing, analyzing, and reporting the results.
Literature search strategies

Literature for this review was identified by searching the
following online databases: bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv,
Google scholar, PubMed, as well as CNKI and WanFang
Data (the two primary databases for biomedical research
in mainland China). These online databases contain archives of most English and Chinese biomedical journals.
In addition, some white papers published online by the
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China, Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and the WHO were included in the analysis. We
searched scientific publications from 1 January to 31
January 2020. The search terms were ‘nCoV’, ‘2019 novel
coronavirus’, ‘2019-nCoV’, ‘novel coronavirus’, ‘Pneumonia’, ‘新型冠状病毒’ (Chinese), ‘新型肺炎’ (Chinese),
and ‘新冠病毒’ (Chinese). We included all the relevant
scientific publications written in English or Chinese in
the review. Non-scientific commentary, reports, and
news articles were excluded from the analysis.

After the articles were selected, data were extracted and
recorded in an excel spreadsheet. The extracted data were
date of publication, language of publication, title of article,
name of journal, author’s country and affiliation, study design, targets of study, sample size, study setting, data collection instrument, research domain, and key findings.

prevention and control. ‘Epidemiology’ includes studies on
the epidemic distribution (when, where, who); ‘causes’ includes studies on virology, pathogenesis, and transmission
patterns; ‘clinical manifestation and diagnosis’ includes
studies on the clinical features (signs and symptoms) and
diagnosis; and ‘prevention and control’ includes studies on
prevention, control, and treatment measures.
Authors’ affiliations were used to categorize the type of
research collaboration. A publication was considered as
deriving from ‘inside China’ when all affiliations of the authors were from China; a publication was considered as
deriving from ‘outside China’ when all affiliations were
outside China; a publication was considered as deriving
from ‘international collaboration’ when at least one affiliation was from China and at least one was from outside
China. The research domains, publishing dates, journal
language, authors’ affiliations, as well as methodological
characteristics were analyzed respectively. All findings and
statements regarding the outbreak in this review are based
on published information as listed in the references.

Summarizing the findings

Results and discussion

Based on the main research objectives, articles were classified into one of the following four research domains: epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, or

Characteristics of published studies

Identification and selection of relevant studies

Two researchers (YW and SPA) independently searched
through the literature. The two sets of literature were then
compared. Disagreements on the inclusion or exclusion of
literature were resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by including a third researcher (HZ) to make the
final decision. Duplicate articles were eliminated. Eventually, 65 unique academic publications were included in
this analysis (Additional file 1). Figure 1 presents a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) flow diagram showing the process of
searching and selecting the research articles [11].
Data extraction from the included studies

Among the 65 research articles included in the analysis,
more than 31 are on preprint servers, and 34 are

published in peer-reviewed journals, including The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine. Most of
the publications (n = 58, 89.2%) are in English and few
(n = 7, 10.8%) are in Chinese. Around 75.9% of English
language publications focus on epidemiology and causes,
while 85.7% of Chinese papers focus on prevention and
control (Table 1).
As shown in Fig. 2, academic publications are distributed across the following research domains: epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, and
prevention and control. The largest portion of the papers (n = 25, 38.5%) are related to causes, followed by papers on epidemiology (n = 19, 29.2%), while 18.5%
examined prevention and control and 13.8% reported
clinical manifestations and diagnosis. Initially, there were
more research articles focused on causes of the outbreak, yet studies on prevention and control gradually
increased over time (Fig. 3). The majority of the articles
(n = 44, 67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars
whereas 29.2% (n = 19) articles were from scholars outside of China. A small number (n = 2, 3.1%) were based
on international collaborative research by scholars from
different countries (Table 2).
We also analyzed the methodological characteristics of
the publications in the final sample. The majority of the
articles are based on mathematical modeling (44.6%) and
cross-sectional study designs (18.5%). Around half of the
studies include targeted populations (patients, general
populations, and healthcare workers) (49.2%) in their
analysis, followed by studies that attempt to identify the
species of the virus (virus structure, gene sequence)
(36.9%). Among the 32 articles with population as the
target of study, 34.4% had a sample size of less than 10,
31.3% were conducted in a hospital setting, and 50%
used secondary data. Quality control activities for data
collection were mentioned in 56.3% of the population
studies (Table 3).
Research domains
Epidemiology

On 29 December 2019, the first four cases of an acute
respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China among
people linked to a local seafood market (“wet market”)

[2]. Research is underway to understand more about
transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
with COVID-19 [3]. It appears that most of the early
cases had some sort of contact history with the original
seafood market [2, 12–14]. Soon, a secondary source of
infection was found to be human-to-human transmission via close contact. There was an increase of infected
people with no history of exposure to wildlife or visiting
Wuhan, and multiple cases of infection were detected
among medical professionals [2, 14–17]. It became clear
that the COVID-19 infection occurs through exposure
to the virus, and both the immunosuppressed and normal population appear susceptible. Some studies have
reported an age distribution of adult patients between 25
and 89 years old. Most adult patients were between 35
and 55 years old [14], and there were fewer identified
cases among children and infants [14, 18]. A study on
early transmission dynamics of the virus reported the
median age of patients to be 59 years, ranging from 15
to 89 years, with the majority (59%) being male [2]. It
was suggested that the population most at risk may be
people with poor immune function such as older people
and those with renal and hepatic dysfunction [2].
The COVID-19 has been found to have higher levels
of transmissibility and pandemic risk than the SARSCoV, as the effective reproductive number (R) of
COVID-19 (2.9) is estimated to be higher than the reported effective reproduction number (R) of SARS (1.77)
at this early stage [15]. Different studies of COVID-19
have estimated the basic reproduction (R0) range to be
from 2.6 to 4.71 (Table 4). The average incubation duration of COVID-19 was estimated to be 4.8 ± 2.6, ranging from 2 to 11 days [15] and 5.2 days (95% confidence
interval, 4.1 to 7) [2]. The latest guidelines from Chinese
health authorities stated an average incubation duration
of 7 days, ranging from 2 to 14 days [23]. Table 4 summarizes the findings on important indicators from these
epidemiological studies.
In China, 11 791 cases were confirmed and 17 988
cases were suspected in 34 provinces as of 24:00, 31
January 2020 (Fig. 4) [32]. Studies indicated that the
spread of COVID-19 was relatively quick and reported
that it had spread to several other countries after its outbreak in China. On 31 January 2020, there were 213


deaths reported globally [33]. Confirmed cases were reported in the following 19 countries outside of China:
Australia (9), Canada (3), Cambodia (1), France (6),
Finland (1), Germany (5), India (1), Italy (2), Japan (14),
Nepal (1), Malaysia (8), the Philippines (1), the Republic
of Korea (11), Singapore (13), Sri Lanka (1), Thailand
(14), the United States of America (6), United Arab
Emirates (4) and Vietnam (5) (Fig. 5) [33].
Causes

Virology and pathogenesis Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that are zoonotic in
nature and cause symptoms ranging from those similar
to the common cold to more severe respiratory, enteric,
hepatic, and neurological symptoms [5, 34]. Other than
SARS-CoV-2, there are six known coronaviruses in
humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoVNL63, HCoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV [2, 23, 35, 36].
Coronavirus has caused two large-scale pandemics in
the last two decades: SARS [37] and MERS [12, 38].

Fig. 3 Publication dates of research articles

To detect the infection source of COVID-19, China CDC
researchers collected 585 environmental samples from the
Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
on 1 January and 12 January 2020. They detected 33 samples
containing SARS-CoV-2 and indicated that it originated
from wild animals sold in the market [39]. Then, researchers
used the lung fluid, blood, and throat swab samples of 15 patients to conduct laboratory tests. These laboratory tests
found that the virus-specific nucleic acid sequences in the
sample are different from those of known human coronavirus species. Laboratory results also indicated that SARSCoV-2 is similar to some of the beta (β) coronaviruses genera identified in bats [12, 18, 40], which is situated in a group
of SARS/SARS-like CoV [12].
To conduct next-generation sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates, researchers
enrolled nine inpatients in Wuhan with viral pneumonia
and negative in common respiratory pathogens. The results of this next-generation sequencing indicated that
SARS-CoV-2 was more distant from SARS-CoV (with

Adhikari et al. Infectious Diseases of Poverty

animal coronaviruses do not spread among humans [3].
However, there are exceptions, such as SARS and MERS,
which are mainly spread though close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets from cough or
sneezing. With regard to COVID-19, early patients were
reported to have some link to the Huanan Seafood Market
in Wuhan, China, suggesting that these early infections
were due to animal-to-person transmission. However,
later cases were reported among medical staff and others
with no history of exposure to that market or visiting Wuhan, which was taken as an indication of human-tohuman transmission [2, 4, 15–17].


The latest guidelines from Chinese health authorities [23, 43] described three main transmission routes
for the COVID-19: 1) droplets transmission, 2) contact transmission, and 3) aerosol transmission. Droplets transmission was reported to occur when
respiratory droplets (as produced when an infected
person coughs or sneezes) are ingested or inhaled by
individuals nearby in close proximity; contact transmission may occur when a subject touches a surface
or object contaminated with the virus and subsequently touch their mouth, nose, or eyes; and aerosol
transmission may occur when respiratory droplets
mix into the air, forming aerosols and may cause infection when inhaled high dose of aerosols into the
lungs in a relatively closed environment [23, 43]. In
addition to these three routes, one study also indicated the digestive system as a potential transmission
route for COVID-19 infection. Since patients had abdominal discomfort and diarrhea symptoms, researchers analyzed four datasets with single-cell
transcriptomes of digestive systems and found that

ACE2 was highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes
from ileum and colon [44].
Clinical manifestation and diagnosis

The complete clinical manifestation is not clear yet, as
the reported symptoms range from mild to severe, with
some cases even resulting in death [3]. The most commonly reported symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia or
fatigue, pneumonia, and complicated dyspnea, whereas
less common reported symptoms include headache,
diarrhea, hemoptysis, runny nose, and phlegmproducing cough [3, 16]. Patients with mild symptoms
were reported to recover after 1 week while severe cases
were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus, which may
lead to death [13]. Cases resulting in death were primarily middle-aged and elderly patients with pre-existing diseases (tumor surgery, cirrhosis, hypertension, coronary
heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease) [13]. Case
definition guidelines mention the following symptoms:
fever, decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells, new


pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, and no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotics treatment [2].
For patients with suspected infection, the following
procedures have been suggested for diagnosis: performing real-time fluorescence (RT-PCR) to detect the positive nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, throat
swabs, and secretions of the lower respiratory tract
samples [13, 14, 43].
Prevention and control

Prevention and control strategies and methods are reported
at three levels: national level, case-related population level,
and general population level. At the national level, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China
issued the “No.1 announcement” on 20 January 2020, which
officially included the COVID-19 into the management of
class B legal infectious diseases, and allowed for class A infectious disease preventive and control measures to be implemented [45]. Under this policy, medical institutes can adopt
isolation treatment and observation protocols to prevent and
control the spread of the COVID-19. On 22 January 2020,
the National Health Commission published national guidelines for the prevention and control of COVID-19 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection [46]. On 28

January 2020, the National Health Commission issued protocols for rapid prevention and control measures in order to
effectively contain the spread of the epidemic through a “big
isolation and big disinfection” policy during the Chinese
Spring Festival [47]. National-level strategies have also been
issued with targeted measures for rural areas (issued on 28
January 2020) and the elderly population (issued on 31 January 2020) [48, 49]. Several public health measures that may
prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19
were introduced; these include case isolation, identification
and follow-up of contacts, environmental disinfection, and
use of personal protective equipment [50].
To date, no specific antiviral treatment has been
confirmed to be effective against COVID-19. Regarding
patients infected with COVID-19, it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment
and supportive care [3, 16]. There are six clinical trials
registered in both the International Clinical Trials Registry platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry to
evaluate the efficacy or safety of targeted medicine in the
treatment or prognosis of COVID-19 (Additional file 2)
[51, 52]. Regarding infected patients with COVID-19, it
has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care [3, 16]. Studies have
also explored the prevention of nosocomial infection

Adhikari et al. Infectious Diseases of Poverty

(2020) 9:29

and psychological health issues associated with COVID19. A series of measures have been suggested to reduce
nosocomial infection, including knowledge training for
prevention and control, isolation, disinfection, classified
protections at different degrees in infection areas, and
protection of confirmed cases [18, 50, 53]. Concerning
psychological health, some suggested psychological
intervention for confirmed cases, suspected cases, and
medical staff [18, 54].
For the general population, at this moment there is
no vaccine preventing COVID-19. The best prevention is to avoid being exposed to the virus [55]. Airborne precautions and other protective measures have
been discussed and proposed for prevention. Infection
preventive and control (IPC) measures that may reduce the risk of exposure include the following: use
of face masks; covering coughs and sneezes with tissues that are then safely disposed of (or, if no tissues
are available, use a flexed elbow to cover the cough
or sneeze); regular hand washing with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (if soap and water are not available); avoidance
of contact with infected people and maintaining an
appropriate distance as much as possible; and refraining from touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands [3].
The WHO also issued detailed guidelines on the use
of face masks in the community, during care at home,
and in the health care settings of COVID-19 [56]. In this
document, health care workers are recommended to use
particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or
FFP2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures
and to use medical masks while providing any care to
suspected or confirmed cases. According to this guideline, individuals with respiratory symptoms are advised
to use medical masks both in health care and home care
settings properly following the infection prevention
guidelines. According to this guideline, an individual
without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a
medical mask when in public. Proper use and disposal of
masks is important to avoid any increase in risk of transmission [56].
In addition to articles published in research journals,
the China CDC published a guideline to raise awareness
of the prevention and control of COVID-19 among the
general population. The key messages of the guideline
include causes, how to choose and wear face masks,
proper hand washing habits, preventive measures at different locations (e.g., at home, on public transportation,
and in public space), disinfection methods, and medical
observation at home [57]. In addition to scientific knowledge on ways to handle the COVID-19 outbreak, the
guideline also suggests ways to eliminate panic among
the general population [57].

Strengths and limitations of the study

The review applied a systematic and rigorous search
strategy to retrieve relevant articles according to the research objectives. This research summarizes scientific
foundations, identifies literature gaps, and suggests some
evidence for future research directions on COVID-19
which will provide information for research community,
policymakers, and health professionals to adjust and/or
come up with new research, policies, and practices. Our
study only focuses on the articles published either in
English or in Chinese during the early outbreak period.
Although, it cannot reflect the entire body of research
on COVID-19 worldwide, it will provide some evidences
for future study and control.

Conclusions
This study shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During
this early period, many studies have been published exploring the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation
and diagnosis, and prevention and control of the novel
coronavirus. Thus far, most studies have focused on the
epidemiology and potential causes. However, studies exploring prevention and control measures have begun to
gradually increase. Studies in this domain are urgently
needed to minimize the impact of the outbreak. Government agencies have quickly incorporated recent scientific findings into public policies at the community,
regional, and national levels to slow down and/or prevent the further spread of the COVID-19. We recommend that the scholarly community conduct further
research to provide valid and reliable ways to manage
this kind of public health emergency in both the shortterm and long-term.
