In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly
used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia.
Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature
search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were
cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database.
Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and
excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction.
In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against
the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the
general in vivo effects of each selected herb.
Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also
found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain
2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral
respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these
26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia
response.

Toward the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) with human-to-human transmission and severe human
infection, originating in Wuhan, China, was identified [1]. This
virus has affected many persons in China and spread to other countries in a very short time. On January 30, 2020, the Director⇑ Corresponding author.

General of the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and issued temporary recommendations under
the International Health Regulations [2]. According to the Daily
Report of China National Health Commission, as of this writing
on February 2, 2020, 14,488 cases, including 304 deaths, have been
confirmed in China; 146 cases, including 1 death, have also been
reported among 23 other countries. This pandemic is still ongoing,
so it is urgent to find new preventive and therapeutic agents as
soon as possible. In addition, commensurate with the risk, strong
measures for early detection, isolation and treatment of cases, as
well as minimization of transmission through social interaction
must be implemented.
While specific vaccines and antiviral agents are the most effective methods to prevent and treat viral infection, there are not yet
effective treatments that target the 2019-nCoV. Development of
these treatments may require months or years, meaning that a
more immediate treatment or control mechanism should be found
if possible. Herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine present a
potentially valuable resource to this end. The effectiveness of
herbal treatment to control contagious disease was demonstrated
during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [3]. As such, the Chinese government is encouraging the
use of herbal plants in fighting this new viral pneumonia. However,
the application of herbal treatment is mainly guided by the type of
herb (based on the catalogue of classic literature on herbs) and the
patient’s symptoms or signs. There is often not enough information
to predetermine whether the herbs in question can directly target
the viral cause, in other words, herbal usage is generally not guided
by viral pathology. We think more detailed knowledge about the
direct antiviral effects of different plants would be greatly helpful
to the doctors selecting them.
In fact, after the outbreak of SARS, many groups dedicated
themselves to finding anti-coronavirus agents, including some natural compounds that exist in traditional Chinese herbal medicines
[4–12]. The coronavirus encodes more than one dozen proteins,
some of which are essential to viral entry and replication. Among
these proteins, the most well-studied are papain-like protease
(PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and spike protein. Coronavirus
PLpro not only processes the viral polypeptide onto functional proteins but is also a deubiquitinating enzyme that can dampen host
anti-viral response by hijacking the ubiquitin (Ub) system. For
example, SARS PLpro cleaves ISG15, a two-domain Ub-like protein,
and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUbLys48 products
[13,14]. SARS-3CLpro is a cysteine protease indispensable to the
viral life cycle [15]. Coronavirus spike protein uses angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 as a receptor to help the virus enter cells
[16]. These three proteins make attractive targets for drug
development.
Through in silico and biological processing, a series of small
molecules, including those from natural compounds, have been
screened and confirmed to directly inhibit these important
proteins in SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
coronavirus [17–23]. The gene sequence of 2019-nCoV has been
released, which suggests high similarities between the main proteins in this virus and those previously identified in SARS-Cov or
MERS-Cov [24,25]. In this sense, previously reported anti-SARSCov or anti-MERS-Cov natural compounds may become a valuable
guide to finding anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) herbal plants
among the traditional Chinese herbs used to treat viral pneumonia.
It is a challenge to screen out the herbs containing anticoronavirus (2019-nCoV) compounds from the large number of
those possibly being used for patients infected with this pathogen,
especially in very short time. Here, we propose two principles to
guide such work: oral effectiveness and traditional usage compatibility. The first principle refers to the fact that most Chinese herbal
plants are orally ingested after boiling with water, meaning that
the anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ingredients in selected plants
should be absorbable via oral preparation. The second principle
recognizes that candidate plants should be consistent with the
type classifications for traditional herbal usage, since type-guided
applications are integral to herbal use, as mentioned above. Following these two principles, we used a 6-step selection process
(3 for each principle), including drug-likeness, evaluation of oral
bioavailability, molecular docking, network pharmacology analysis
and other methods to identify herbs that have both a high possibil-
