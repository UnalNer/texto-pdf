Abstract
A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory
syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high
homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs.
Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic
agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses
against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding
clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and
considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a
therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the
future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.
Key words: Neutralizing antibody, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome

Introduction
The occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province of
China firstly emerged in December 2019. A newly
identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, formerly
known as 2019-nCoV) is causing pneumoniaassociated respiratory syndrome [1]. After analysis of
genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained
from different infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 shares
high sequence identity with SARS-CoV [2]. Compared
to SARS-CoV, transmitted from human-to-human of
SARS-CoV-2 seems to be greater. As of February 2020,
at least 25 countries reported >70,000 cases of SARSCoV-2 infection. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
show typical pneumonia and severe lung damage [3].
COVID-19 can be diagnosed by either clinical CT
radiography or a laboratory real time Reverse
Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
[4]. Unfortunately, there are no specific antiviral
drugs or vaccines currently. Several approaches can
be suggested to control infections of SARS-CoV-2,
including
vaccines,
monoclonal
antibodies,
oligonucleotides, peptides, interferon and small-

molecule drugs [5]. The antibody-mediated
humoral response is crucial for preventing viral
infections. A subset of these antibodies, which reduce
viral infectivity by binding to the surface epitopes of
viral particles and thereby blocking the entry of the
virus to an infected cell, are defined as neutralizing
antibodies (NAbs) [6]. NAbs elicit their protective
activities in three main steps. NAbs may prevent the
attachment of the virion to its receptors on targeted
cells, causing aggregation of virus particles. Further,
the viruses are lysed through the constant (C) region
of
the
antibody-mediated
opsonization
or
complement activation [7]. This review focuses on
understanding immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2
and addressing the benefits, challenges and
considerations of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).

SARS-CoV in antigen and receptor
recognition by host

of SARS-CoV-2 include the spike (S), membrane (M)
and envelop (E) and nucleic capsid (N) proteins [8]. A
coronavirus initiates cell fusion via attachment of the
S protein with the receptor on the host cell surface.
The viral nucleocapsid is delivered inside for
subsequent replication. The S protein comprises two
units, S1 and S2. The receptor-binding domain (RBD)
within S1 directly interacts with host receptors [9].
Structural and functional analysis of the SARS-CoV-2
shows that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds the
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on
human alveolar epithelial cells [10-12], suggesting
SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, ACE2, as
SARS-CoV. However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S
[13]. The high affinity of the S protein for human
ACE2 may lead to the great human-to-human
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the key role of
the S protein, it is the main target for antibodymediated neutralization.

Innate and adaptive responses of human
to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
The clinical spectrum of the outcome of
COVID-19 is highly variable, from mild flu-like
symptoms to severe pneumonia. It is critical to take
insights into cellular and humoral responses in
SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 [14]. Elucidation of
SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis is useful for
developing passive antibody therapy, designing
vaccines, and understanding of clinical drug
interventions. However, the systemic landscape of the
immune responses in patients with COVID-19 is
unclear. Because the clinical features and

immunopathogenesis
of
SARS-CoV-2
pose
similarities with SARS-CoV [15], knowledge learned
from SARS-CoV has important implications for
understanding this new coronavirus.
Resistance to SARS-CoV infections is associated
with both innate and adaptive immune responses
[16]. The innate immune response to SARS-CoV has
not been completely defined [17]. Some studies
demonstrated that both macrophage and dendritic
cell (DC) play the important roles for viral destruction
and immune response induction in mucosalassociated lymphoid tissues [18]. Due to homeostasis,
macrophage and DC as vehicles seemed to
disseminate viruses through the efferent lymphatic
system. Meanwhile, activation of DC and macrophage
by SARS-CoV led to excessive pro-inflammatory
cytokine responses [19]. A drastic elevation of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was
observed in the tissues and serum of SARS-CoV
patients [20]. The levels of, IFN-γ, IL-1β IL-6, IL-12,
IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 are generally enhanced in the
early infection and subsequently reduced in the
recovery stage. Uncontrolled systemic inflammation
(known as cytokine storm) further resulted in illness
severity. The similar symptom of cytokine storm was
observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, IP-10, and
MCP-1), which may lead to activated T-helper-1 (Th1)
cell responses, were upregulated [21,22]. However,
SARS-CoV-2 patients secreted excessive IL-4 and
IL-10 that may suppress inflammation via T-helper-2
(Th2) [14]. It differs from SARS-CoV infection. Further
studies are necessary to elucidate innate responses in
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

The adaptive immune response mainly consists
of cellular (T cell) and humoral (B cell) responses. T
cell-mediated responses in SARS-CoV infection have
been well elucidated [23]. Both CD4+ and CD8+
T-cells provided broad and long-term protection.
CD4+ T cells promoted the proliferation of
neutralizing antibodies, whereas CD8+ T cells were
responsible for the destruction of viral infected cells.
Although all SARS‐CoV surface proteins, including S,
M, E, and N proteins were involved in T cell
responses, S protein contributed to the most T-cell
recognition epitopes. Overall frequency of CD8+T cell
response predominates over CD4+T cell response.
Lymphopenia occurred in both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 infections [14,24,25]. The reduction of CD4+
and CD8+ T cells is commonly associated with
lymphopenia. It will be interesting to elucidate T-cell
mediated response in SARS-CoV-2 infection that may
provide important hints for the design of the vaccine
composed of viral structural proteins. On the other
hand, patients with SARS-CoV infection had the
strong humoral immune response to SARS-CoV [26,
27]. Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to SARS-CoV
appeared in patients after primary SARS infection
[28]. Neutralizing IgGs played a major role in the
neutralization of the SARS-CoV. IgGs reached the
peak in serum during the convalescent phase and
diminished after recovery [29]. Memory B cells still
provided the long-term protection in associated with
cellular immune responses [30]. Despite markedly
reducing virus replication, anti-S protein neutralizing
IgGs could be associated with fatal acute lung injury
through promoting IL-8/MCP-1 production and
inflammatory macrophage accumulation [31]. These
studies may provide important implications for
observing IgG response in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

Advances in the development of
neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV
NAbs provide important specific immune
defense against viral infections in patients [32] [33,34].
Numbers of antiviral NAbs have been developed in
recent years, and some are now in clinical

1720
development. The role and importance of NAbs in
protection from SARS-CoV infection has been
thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [7,35-38]. Entry of
SARS-CoV into the host cell is mediated by the
attachment of S protein and ACE-2 receptor. The S
protein is the major inducer of NAbs. Particularly,
RBD within S1 unit is the most critical target for
SARS-CoV NAbs [39]. Such NAbs can interrupt the
interaction of RBD and its receptor ACE2. Most of
NAbs have been identified to recognize RBD region
[40-46]. Interestingly, some NAbs still showed to
recognize epitopes on S2 unit [47], suggesting that
other mechanisms could be involved in the
neutralization. At last virus clearance was mediated
by antibody-dependent opsonization or complement
activation [7]. These NAbs against SARS-CoV are
summarized in Table 1.
Phage display has been used to identify
neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against
SARS-CoV from both naïve and immune antibody
libraries. The selected antibodies, 80R [40], CR3014
[41], CR3022 [42], m396 [43], blocked the binding of S1
domain and ACE2. 80R, CR3013 and m396 showed
virus neutralization and prophylaxis capability in
either vitro or animal models. Although CR3022 did
not showed much neutralization alone, the mixture of
CR3022 and CR3014 showed neutralization of
SARS-CoV in a synergistic effect due to recognition of
different epitopes on RBD [42]. A method for EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) transformation of human B cells was
used to isolate NAbs. Six groups of NAbs, which were
divided based on differential neutralization of SARSCoV variants, have been successfully identified from
memory B cells from SARS-CoV infected patients [30].
Furthermore,
transgenic
mice
with
human
immunoglobulin genes have been used to produce
NAbs against SARS-CoV by antigen immunization.
Two NAbs, 201 and 68, were identified from
transgenic mice [44,45]. They were effective for virus
prophylaxis in animal models. On the other hand,
several NAbs, B1 [46], 1F8 and 5E9 [47], against
epitopes on SARS-CoV S2 still showed effectiveness in
neutralization.

Perspectives on the development of
neutralizing antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2
The simplest and most direct approach to
combating SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak would
be to use plasma from the convalescent patients [48].
Polyclonal NAbs could be induced in some
convalescent patients and will be effective in treating
SARS-CoV-2 [12]. These NAbs can provide passive
immune responses to viral infection. Indeed, both
SARS and Ebola patients received the treatment of
convalescent plasma [49,50]. However, the outcomes
of passive plasma therapy are unpredictable due to
variability of sera in different patients.
Development of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 is a
relatively rapid approach to obtain the standardized
agents that control re-emergence of COVID-19 [51].
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is likely important target
for developing NAbs to block binding and fusion of
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 seems to use the
same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV
because ACE2 shows binding to RBD of both SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 [11]. However, a recent study
demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds ACE2
with higher affinity than SARS-CoV (10- to 20-folder)
[13], suggesting its recognition to ACE2 could be
different with SARS-CoV. Although SARS-CoV-2
shows the high homology with SARS-CoV, antibody

cross-reactivity is limited between the two virus S
proteins. Several published SARS-CoV NAbs do not
have appreciable binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein
[13,52]. A recent study shows that a SARS-CoV
antibody, CR3022, binds to SARS-CoV-2 RBD [52], but
its neutralization capability is uncertain. Cocktail of
NAbs has showed the stronger neutralization than
alone in treatment of both Ebola and SARS viruses
[47,53]. This finding suggests that a cocktail antibody
approach for SARS-CoV-2 could be undertaken.
Therefore, it will be very meaningful to generate
NAbs targeting different epitopes on SARS-CoV-2.
Combination of several potent NAbs could decrease
the probability for escape virus isolates with
decreased sensitivity to neutralization.
Computational simulation of antibody-antigen
complexes has been used to guide the design of
therapeutic antibodies [54-56]. Numbers of antibody
structures (currently around 2,000 depositions) are
available in the Protein Data Bank [PDB]. Based on
these PDB data, the comparative model of an
antibody onto the viral surface antigen can be
predicted. The key residues between RBD and NAbs
can be identified to provide important implications
for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The key
residues of interface between an antibody and the
antigen can be optimized to produce high afﬁnity [57].
Several recent computer docking models have been
used to predict the interaction between S protein and
human ACE2 [10] or antibodies [52]. The studies

revealed the important discovery that SARS-CoVspecific CR3022 antibody could cross-react to SARSCoV-2.

Conclusion
The availability of therapeutic NAbs against
SARS-CoV-2 will offer benefits for the control of the
current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of
the virus in the future, and their development
therefore remains a high priority. The efforts of NAb
development will surely be an area of intense research
in the coming months and even years. Currently,
several strategies are used in the clinic or under
development, such as viral-targeting therapeutics and
host-targeting
agents
(such
as
interferons,
glucocorticoids) for the treatment of COVID-19. As
compared with these therapeutic strategies, NAbs
appear to be more specific for virions. Understanding
of action mechanisms of NAbs may provide valuable
implications for the rapid development of antibody
therapy and vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. However, the
development of NAb-based therapeutics is a timeconsuming and laborious process. To date, no NAb
agents for either SARS-CoV or (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) MERS-CoV are
available in the market. Meanwhile, a note of caution
is that the effect of antibody immune response in
protecting against pulmonary pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV is controversial [31]. Some patients who
died of SARS showed the strong NAb responses and
pulmonary
proinflammatory
accumulation,
suggesting NAbs could be associated with fatal acute
lung injury. Therefore, it is important to take insight
into humoral and cellular responses of SARS-CoV-2
when antiviral immunotherapy is developed.
