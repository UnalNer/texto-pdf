bovine coronavirus, virus shedding, and
treatment for bovine respiratory disease in
pre-weaned beef calves

Abstract
Background: Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is associated with respiratory infections in cattle of all ages; however, a
temporal study to evaluate the effect of BCV immunity on virus shedding and bovine respiratory disease (BRD)
incidence in pre-weaned beef calves has not been reported. Thus, we report here a prospective study in three
herds of crossbred beef calves (n = 817) with endemic BCV.
Serial blood samples for measurement of serum anti-BCV antibody titers and nasal swabs for detection of BCV and
other common viral and bacterial BRD pathogens were collected from all calves or subsets of calves at predetermined
times from birth through weaning. The calves were monitored for BRD and those that developed signs of respiratory
disease were sampled for diagnostic testing. To discover additional risk factors that could have influenced BRD
development, sequence analysis of the BCV strain(s) circulating in each herd, and the prevalence of common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also
evaluated.
Results: Two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study calves (30.4%) were treated for BRD prior to weaning; 246 of those
were from a single herd involved in two outbreaks of BRD leading to mass treatment of all calves in that group.
Molecular diagnostic testing found BCV and Histophilus somni in nasal swabs taken at the time of BRD treatment.
Between herd analyses revealed anti-BCV serum antibody abundance did not associate with the incidence of BRD or
BCV shedding, though these measurements may have been hindered by the long periods between sample collections.
Analysis of the BCV spike gene hypervariable region revealed four polymorphisms in 15 isolates from the three herds,
making strain variation unlikely to account for differences in treatment rates between herds. Persistent or recurrent
shedding episodes of BCV occurred in some animals treated for BRD.
Conclusion: Co-detection of BCV and H. somni at the time of the disease outbreak suggests that these pathogens
contributed to disease pathogenesis. Developing appropriate control measures for respiratory BCV infections may help
decrease the incidence of pre-weaning BRD. The role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined.

Background
Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality for all production classes of
cattle and calves in the U.S., causing losses to the cattle
industry in excess of $1 billion dollars annually [1, 2].
Multiple etiologies, including both viral and bacterial,
contribute to BRD [3]. Those generally accepted to be
important contributors to BRD include the viral pathogens bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea
virus types 1 and 2 (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial
virus (BRSV) and parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3); and the
bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis [2, 4].
BRD is frequently initiated by a viral infection that disrupts local defenses and/or causes immune suppression,
allowing opportunistic bacterial pathogens that are in
healthy animals as normal nasophayngeal commensals
to proliferate and infect the lungs [2, 4]. Superimposed
environmental or management related stress (such as
adverse weather, shipping, and commingling) can further
suppress the host immune system, increase pathogen
exposure, and may be important co-requisites in many
BRD outbreaks [4]. Although vaccines and antibiotic
treatments are readily available to prevent and treat
infection caused by common BRD pathogens, the
incidence of disease remains high [5].
In recent years, bovine coronavirus (BCV) has been
implicated as an important contributor to BRD [6].
Although initially described as being associated with calf
diarrhea, BCV has been found to infect the upper and
lower respiratory tract and has been isolated from pneumonic lungs alone or in combination with other respiratory pathogens [7–12]. In addition, results of multiple
studies indicate that groups of cattle with high titers of
serum antibodies to BCV at the time of feedlot entry are
less likely to shed BCV and develop BRD than those
with low anti-BCV serum antibody titers [7, 13–15].
Taken together, it appears that BCV contributes to feedlot BRD, and high titers of serum anti-BCV antibodies
associate with reduced risk of BCV infection and disease.
However, it remains unknown whether the serum antibodies themselves are immune correlates of protection,
or whether they simply reflect prior exposure to the
virus [6].
The relationship between BCV and BRD in preweaned beef calves has not been comprehensively evaluated. Though BCV is frequently detected in nasal swabs
from nursing calves with BRD, subclinical BCV
infections are also common in young dairy calves, even
in the presence of relatively high anti-BCV antibody
titers [16, 17]. These results raise questions about the
association between anti-BCV antibody titers and BCV
shedding with the risk of developing BRD in nursing
dairy calves. Similarly, in a 2014 study, our group

Page 2 of 15

sampled four research herds (n = 890) at predefined
times from birth through their fifth week in the feedlot
[15]. This study revealed that the herds in which BCV
was detected in nasal sections during the pre-weaning
period also had the highest incidence of pre-weaning
BRD; however, nasal swabs were not collected at the
time of treatment to diagnose the pathogens associated
with those pre-weaning BRD cases. This study also
reported that serum anti-BCV antibody abundance did
not correlate with BCV shedding prior to weaning. Thus,
while mounting evidence suggests that anti-BCV
antibodies protect weaned feedlot cattle from BRD associated with BCV infection, the relationship between
humoral immunity to BCV, virus shedding, and the risk
for developing BRD in nursing calves remains unclear.
This represents a major obstacle in the development of
effective control strategies to reduce the impact of
BCV-related respiratory disease in cattle, which is
significant given that there are currently no licensed
BCV vaccines in the United States to aid in the prevention of BRD.
To address this knowledge gap, the present study
serially sampled 817 calves from three herds of beef
cattle from birth through weaning to determine whether
shedding of BCV is associated with BRD and whether
levels of anti-BCV serum antibodies associate with BCV
shedding or BRD incidence in pre-weaned beef calves.
Sequence analysis of the virus strain(s) circulating in
each herd and the prevalence of common opportunistic
bacterial pathogens (M. haemolytica, P. multocida, H.
somni and Mycoplasma bovis) in the upper respiratory
tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also evaluated to account for potentially confounding factors that
could influence BRD development in these populations.

Methods
Ethical statement

All experimental procedures were performed with
approval and under the guidelines of the US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC approval numbers
5438–31,000–082-04 (24) and 3040–32,000–031-07 (5)).
Study population

Eight hundred seventeen natural-service, crossbred beef
calves born between March 24 and May 24, 2016, were
followed from birth through weaning (Fig. 1). The calves
were part of the ongoing germplasm evaluation program
at the USMARC, located on approximately 35,000 acres
near Clay Center, Nebraska, USA [18]. Calves were a
product of multiple-sire matings of crossbred cows to F1
bulls of varying breed composition. The resulting calves
used within this study consisted of variable fractions of
18 breeds: Angus, Hereford, Red Angus, Brahman,

were enrolled in the study because calves that were born
as a result of artificial insemination were enrolled in
another study on center. As result, there are differences
in the mean age and weight of study calves at weaning
(Table 1). The additional calves in each herd were
managed identically to the target population but were
not sampled for this study.
Vaccination schedule and calf processing

Fig. 1 Timeline of calf vaccinations and sample collection. For
vaccine details see Methods section. Of note, at no time during the
study were calves vaccinated with a BCV containing vaccine. Mass
treatment for BRD occurred in a subset of claves from Herd 2 on
August 5, 2016 (mass treatment 1, MT-1; n = 93 study calves) and
August 12, 2016 (mass treatment 2, MT-2; n = 142 study calves).

Beefmaster, Shorthorn, Maine Anjou, Santa Gertrudis,
Chiangus, Salers, Braunvieh, South Devon, and
Tarentaise.
Study calves originated from three research herds that
were managed in separate locations at USMARC. The
three herds did not have fence-line contact, so there was
no direct pathogen transmission between herds. These
calves were raised with similar management and
received standardized vaccinations (as described below).
Herd characteristics, including the number of calves
enrolled in this study from each herd, median dam
parity within each herd, and mean ± standard deviation
weaning age and weight for the study calves were
summarized in Table 1. Each of these three herds
contained calves in addition to the target population
enrolled in the study. Herds 1 and 2 consisted of calves
that were born as a result of artificial insemination or
natural service, whereas Herd 3 consisted of only calves
that were born as a result of full-season natural service
breeding. Only natural service calves from each herd

Dams: The dams in all three herds received a modified
live virus (MLV) vaccine-bacterin combination product
(Bovi-Shield Gold FP 5 VL 5, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ)
that contained MLV strains of BHV-1, BVDV types 1
and 2, PI3, BRSV, and an inactivated suspension of Campylobacter fetus and 5 strains of Leptospira. This vaccine
was given annually, prior to breeding (approximately
June, one to three weeks before breeding). The dams
were also vaccinated against enteric pathogens approximately 30 days before the beginning of calving season.
That vaccine (Scourguard 4KC; Zoetis) contained killed
strains of bovine rotavirus and BCV, a K99 Escherichia
coli bacterin, and Clostridium perfringens type C toxoid.
This vaccine enhances the production and secretion of
antibodies against those pathogens into the colostrum to
aid in the prevention of diarrhea in calves. This is the
only BCV containing vaccine used in the study.
Calves: A timeline of calf vaccinations is provided in
Fig. 1. At approximately 10 to 50 days of age (initial vaccination), calves received a MLV vaccine-bacterin combination product (Bovi-Shield Gold One Shot, Zoetis)
that contained MLV strains of BHV-1, BVDV types 1
and 2, PI3, BRSV, and Mannheimia haemolytica and a
multivalent bacterin-toxoid product (Vision 7 with Spur,
Merck, Kenilworth, NJ) intended to protect animals
against disease caused by Clostridium sp. and Moraxella
bovis. At preconditioning processing, (21 days prior to
weaning; calves 92 to 159 days old), calves received a
booster of the respiratory vaccine (Bovi-Shield Gold One
Shot, Zoetis) and another multivalent clostridial vaccine
(Vision 8, Merck). Calves were weaned into the feedlot
at 113 to 180 days of age. Of note, at no time in the
study did the calves receive a BCV containing vaccine.
Sampling procedures

A timeline of sample collection is shown in Fig. 1 and the
number and types of samples taken at each time point is
summarized in Table 2. A 9 mL blood sample for plasma
acquisition was collected between 18 and 48 h after birth
from a small subset of calves for which both birth and the
first nursing episode were observed (n = 169, [herd 1 = 33;
herd 2 = 82; herd 3 = 54]). A 9–25 mL blood sample (for
serum acquisition) and nasal swab specimens (for pathogen detection) were collected from all study calves (n =
817) at initial vaccination, preconditioning, and weaning.

These three sampling periods were selected to minimize
stress on the calves from excess handling, as calves were
routinely processed and vaccinated at those production
stages at USMARC. An additional 9 mL blood sample and
nasal swab samples were collected from calves at the time
of treatment for BRD during the study period (n = 234
calves sampled of 248 treatments).
Blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture
using 18-gauge needles at birth and initial vaccination
and 16-gauge needles at later sampling points. Plasma or
serum were separated from other blood components via
centrifugation (1650 x g, 25 min, 4 °C) and stored at −
80 °C. Nasal samples were collected from the upper
nasal cavity of calves using sterile 6-in. cotton-tipped
swabs. For sampling, the nasal swab was gently inserted
into the nasal cavity at an approximate depth of 6 in.,
rotated, and removed. Nasal swabs were placed in
cryovials containing 1 mL transport medium (buffered
peptone water with 12% glycerol), snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C.
Mass treatment in response to pre-weaning BRD
outbreak

Two subsets of calves in Herd 2 (n = 235) were mass
treated for BRD in August 2016, according to the
USMARC standard operating procedure (SOP) for intervention in disease outbreaks (Fig. 1). At dam prebreeding processing (approximately June), the dams and their
calves were split into three breeding groups based on
dam age. During breeding, groups were separated by at
least one pasture, so no breeding groups shared
fence-line contact at this time. On August 5, 2016, calves
in one breeding group (n = 93 study calves) were mass
treated for BRD following the observation by the attending veterinarian that approximately 15–20% of the calves
were displaying clinical signs of BRD, including: cough,

nasal discharge, increased respiratory rate, lethargy, and
anorexia. Calves were individually restrained in a
squeeze chute for sample collection (as described above)
and treatment (Draxxin (tulathromycin; macrolide), Zoetis) then returned to their pasture. On August 12, 2016,
a second breeding group (n = 142 study calves) was mass
treated with a different antibiotic (Zuprevo (tildipirosin;
macrolide), Merck) following the observation that 25–
30% of the calves in that pasture were displaying clinical
signs of BRD. They were similarly sampled, treated, and
returned to their pasture. All treatment decisions were
made by the attending veterinarians and carried out according to SOP.
Detection of viral pathogens by RT-qPCR

A multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect BCV,
BRSV, BVDV, and BHV-1 in nasal swab samples as
previously described [15] using primer and probe sets
from previously published reports [19–22]. Briefly, RNA
was extracted from 250 μl of sample using a phenol and
guanidine isothiocyanate reagent (TRIzol LS, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and DNA was extracted
from 200 μl of sample using a silica-membrane-based
nucleic acid purification kit (QIAamp DNA mini kit,
Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Cyclic amplification
reactions were carried out in a 25 μl reaction containing:
4.5 mM MgCl2, 400 μM concentration of each dNTP,
0.4 μM concentration of each primer, 0.2 μM concentration of each probe, 1 μl enzyme mix containing reverse
transcriptase (RT) and a hot start Taq polymerase (OneStep RT-PCR kit, Qiagen Inc.), and 2.5 μl each of RNA
and DNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: reverse
transcription for 30 min at 50 °C, inactivation of RT
enzyme and activation of Taq polymerase for 15 min at
95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60

Workman et al. BMC Veterinary Research

(2019) 15:161

s and 72 °C for 60 s. Ct values < 40 were considered
positive. Positive, negative, no template, and extraction
controls were included on each run.
For swabs taken from Herd 2 calves at the time of
mass treatment for BRD, 100 μL of transport medium
from nasal swab samples were pooled together into
groups of approximately five based on collection date
and the calf’s rectal temperature at the time of treatment.
This pooling strategy was utilized to determine whether
there were differences in the prevalence of pathogens
between calves with a normal rectal temperature and
those with an elevated rectal temperature at the time of
treatment for BRD. RT-qPCR results are presented for the
pooled samples.
Subclinical shedding of viral pathogens was also
assessed by RT-qPCR methods in 60 randomly selected
study calves from each of the three herds at initial
vaccination, preconditioning, and weaning. This sample
size yielded a 95% probability of detecting at least one
infected animal if the true shedding prevalence was at
least 5% in the herd at that production stage [23]. At each
sample acquisition time, 100 μL of transport medium from
nasal swab samples were pooled together into groups of
five based on originating herd. Samples from pools found
to be positive for viral RNA or DNA were then processed
individually to identify the positive individual(s) in each
pool. RT-qPCR results are reported for the number of
individuals identified as positive after testing all individuals in the positive pools.
Detection of bacteria by qPCR

DNA extracted from pooled nasal swab medium was
sent to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Veterinary
Diagnostic Center for bacterial diagnostics by multiplex
qPCR using the QuantiFast multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen
Inc.) and primers and probes designed to detect M. haemolytica, P. multocida, H. somni and Mycoplasma bovis.
This test has been validated for use with bovine nasal
swabs and lung tissue matrices [24].
BCV antibody detection ELISA

Passively acquired immunity to BCV (maternal antibodies) was evaluated in a subset of calves from each
herd (n = 169, [herd 1 = 33; herd 2 = 82; herd 3 = 54]) by
measuring the abundance of serum anti-BCV IgG
antibodies in the calf at 18–48 h after birth. BCV
antibodies were also measured for each of the 180 calves
(60 from each herd) that were evaluated for BCV
shedding at initial vaccination, preconditioning, and
weaning. Additionally, antibody levels were measured
over time, from birth through weaning, in 39 calves from
Herd 2 that were involved in the mass treatment event
for pre-weaning BRD on August 12, 2016.

Page 5 of 15

Antibody levels were measured using a commercially
available indirect antibody ELISA (BCV antibody ELISA,
Boehringer Ingelheim Svanova, Uppsala, Sweden)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described [15]. Briefly, optical densities (OD) were
used to calculate the BCV antibody percent positivity, by
dividing the OD of the unknown clinical sample by the
OD of the positive control provided in the kit. As per
the manufacturer’s specification, a percent positivity
value of < 10 was considered to be seronegative, while >
10 was considered to be seropositive. However, because
the goal of this study was to compare antibody abundance between animals and herds and correlate these
values with virus shedding and disease incidence, we first
experimentally determined the linear range of the kit
[15]. A good linear range from OD 0.1–1.5 was demonstrated. When measured values were compared to
expected values, the linearity was found to fit the following equation: Y = 1.657(X)-0.08916, R2 = 0.999. All samples that were above an OD 1.4 were diluted further and
retested. The adjusted percent positivity was then
calculated based on the dilution factor of the clinical
sample times the percent positivity. This value was
accepted as the relative anti-BCV antibody abundance.
The kit sensitivity is estimated to be 84.6% and the
specificity is reported to be 100% [25, 26]. To reduce
variation, kits of the same lot number were used for all
tests.
BCV neutralizing antibody detection by a virus
neutralization test

A microtitration virus neutralization test (VNT) was
used to determine titers of neutralizing anti-BCV antibodies in a subset of serum and plasma samples (n = 60).
The goal was to evaluate the relationship between total
anti-BCV reactive antibodies measured by ELISA and
neutralizing antibody titers measured by a VNT. For
these tests, HRT-18G cells (ATCC CRL11663) were
grown and maintained in MEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO), 1x
antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco), and 2 mM L-glutamine
(Gibco). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 8 × 103
cells/well and incubated at 37 °C for 4 days or until cells
were just confluent. Cells were then washed two times
with diluent #5 (MEM supplemented with 1x
antibiotic-antimycotic and 1% NaHCO3 [27];) and then
incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in 100 uL diluent #5. During
this incubation, serial 2-fold dilutions of the serum/
plasma samples were made in MEM in a separate
96-well plate using duplicate rows for each sample. The
challenge virus (described below) was diluted in MEM
to contain 100 tissue culture infective dose50 per well
(100 TCID50/well) and was added to the serum. The

Workman et al. BMC Veterinary Research

virus and serum were incubated for one hour at 37 °C
before being transferred to the HRT-18G cells. Plates
were incubated for 4–5 d in the 37 °C incubator. The
endpoint titer was the final serum/plasma dilution that
completely inhibited the viral cytopathic effects in both
wells. Sera were tested in duplicate with known negative
control sera in the assay.
Two challenge strains were used for the VNT: the cell
culture adapted US reference enteric strain, Mebus
(kindly provided by Dr. Linda Saif; The Ohio State
University, Columbus, OH); and a respiratory strain
isolated in 2014 from a naturally-infected calf in the
same research herd as the serum samples to be tested
(BRCV_2014). BRCV_2014 was propagated six times in
HRT-18G cells. The Mebus virus strain has been
passaged in multiple cell types and the passage number
was unknown.

Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance (class regression) models for
differences in weight, age, and maternal antibodies

Differences between weaning weights, weaning ages, or
maternal BCV IgG antibodies (log) across herds were
analyzed in a model where location was fixed and
animals were the residual.
Analysis of variance (class regression) models for
differences in bacterial prevalence

Bacterial prevalence (yes or no) in the outbreaks and
bacterial abundances were tested relative to body
temperature above or below 39.4 °C (103 °F) in a model
that included the mass treatment event (MT-1 or − 2),
temperature status (above/below 39.4 °C) and their interaction. Due to the binary nature of prevalence as a
response variable, a logistic generalized model was fitted
to prevalence.

BCV spike gene sequencing

A total of 15 BCV-positive nasal swab samples were sequenced directly from non-cultured clinical samples: six
were from Herd 2 at the time of mass treatment, eight
from preconditioning (two from Herd 1, four from Herd
2 and two from Herd 3), and one from weaning (Herd
2). Prior to RNA extraction, nasal swabs were treated
with RNase and DNase to deplete host and contaminating environmental nucleic acid as previously described
[28, 29]. The remaining nucleic acid was extracted using
Trizol LS (Life Technologies). A nested PCR was then
used to amplify a 1102 bp fragment of the spike gene,
including the hypervariable S1 region used for
phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus stains [30]. The
primers were: BCV Forward: 5′-GATAAGTTTGCAATA-CCCAATGG-3’ [31], BCV Reverse: 5′-GTAAACCGATAACCAGTGG-3’ [30], Nest Forward: 5′-TGCA
ATACCCAATGGTAGG-3′, Nest Reverse: 5′-TGTAGAGTAATCCACACAGT-3′ [32]. A 5 μl sample of the final
PCR product was run on a 1% agarose gel to confirm
amplification of the 1102 bp product. These fragments
were then purified from the remaining PCR sample
by exonuclease treatment (Exo I, Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s
specifications. DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and sequenced twice in the forward direction and
twice in the reverse direction using the above nested coronavirus primers at a commercial sequencing facility
(Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ). Resulting sequence data
was then analyzed and edited using commercial software
(Geneious, version 9.1.8, Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Sequence alignments were carried out using
MUSCLE [33] within Geneious. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) locations were determined manually by
comparison with the BCV strain Mebus reference genome
(accession number U00735.2).

Analysis of variance (class regression) models for
differences in BCV IgG serum antibody levels (log)

Changes in BCV IgG serum antibody levels (log) over
time were modeled as repeated measures with unstructured multinomial covariances between the residuals at
different time points. Location, time, and their interaction were tested as fixed in this model. Within herd
two, where the BRD outbreaks occurred, breeding group
was fitted as fixed rather than location to track differences in the groups that were mass treated. Finally, to
examine the relationship between BCV shedding and
anti-BCV IgG antibody levels in different herds, IgG
level (log) was modeled within timepoints with fixed
effects of location, shedding status, and their interaction
and animal as the residual.
Quantification of the relationship between VNT and ELISA

Pearson’s correlation coefficients were derived to
describe the linear relationship between the results
obtained by VNT and ELISA and between the VNT
using Mebus and BRCV 2014 challenge strains.

Results
BRD treatment

Two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study claves (30.4%)
were treated for BRD prior to weaning. Two of these
calves were from Herd 1 and the remaining 246 cases
were from Herd 2. No study calves from Herd 3 were
treated for BRD. No co-morbidity such as diarrhea was
observed in BRD cases, and no study calves were treated
for diarrhea at any point during the study.
The number of calves treated for BRD is inflated for
Herd 2 because two subsets of calves from this herd
(sorted into breeding groups at this time based on dam
age) were involved in outbreaks of BRD leading to mass

Workman et al. BMC Veterinary Research

treatment of all calves in that group (n = 235; Methods
and Fig. 1). At the time of the first mass treatment
(MT-1), 22 of the 93 study calves (24%) had a rectal
temperature ≥ 39.4 °C (103 °F), which was a threshold indication that an infectious or inflammatory process was
occurring in the calves. The mean age of the calves at
the time of MT-1 was 94 days (range: 74–126 days). The
calves involved in the second mass treatment (MT-2)
had a mean age of 113 days (range: 81–141 days) and 44
of the 142 calves (44%) had a rectal temperature ≥ 39.4 °
C at the time of treatment. The remaining 11 cases from
Herd 2 were treated outside the time of the mass treatment events and samples/rectal temperatures were not
obtained. Five of those cases were from the third breeding group that was not mass treated for BRD
(Additional file 1).
Pre-weaning BRD cases were associated with the
detection of BCV in nasal swab specimens

Molecular diagnostics were carried out on 234 nasal
swab specimens collected from Herd 2 at the time of
mass treatment to detect some of the most common
viral (BCV, BHV-1, BVDV and BRSV) and bacterial (M.
haemolytica, P. multocida, H. somni and M. bovis) pathogens associated with BRD. BCV was detected in 48 of
48 pools of nasal swabs across both treatment dates. No
statistically significant difference in relative abundance
(as determined by RT-qPCR cycle threshold; Ct) was detected between treatment dates or between those with a
rectal temperature ≥ 39.4 °C and those with normal rectal temperature within treatment dates (Fig. 2a-c). No
other respiratory viral pathogens were detected.
Opportunistic bacterial pathogens H. somni, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida were detected in nasal swabs
from calves across both treatment dates as summarized
in Fig. 2. There were differences in both the prevalence
and relative abundance of H. somni and M. haemolytica
between the two treatment dates, and a difference in P.
multocida abundance (P < 0.05). Within treatment dates,
there was no statistical difference in the relative abundance of these bacteria when analyzed by rectal
temperature. M. bovis was not detected in any nasal
swab specimen.
Given that these bacteria are commensals found in the
upper respiratory tract (URT) of clinically normal animals, and samples were not collected from apparently
healthy controls outside of the treatment groups, interpretation of these results can be challenging. Therefore,
the presence of these bacteria was determined two weeks
(MT-2) or three weeks (MT-1) after the outbreak at routine preconditioning processing in untreated and previously treated calves from the same herd to help
determine which (if any) bacteria may have been associated with the BRD outbreak (Fig. 3). Interestingly, at the

Page 7 of 15

time of mass treatment, H. somni was detected in 94%
of the pools tested across both treatment dates (Fig. 2).
At preconditioning, there was no evidence of H. somni
in the recovered calves previously treated for BRD or in
control calves from the same herd that were not involved in the mass treatment events (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, there was no evidence of H. somni in the nasal
cavity of these same calves at initial vaccination, which
was prior to the BRD outbreak (data not shown).
M. haemolytica and P. multocida were also detected at
high levels in the calves treated for BRD; however, these
bacteria were also detected in 100% of the pools at
preconditioning from clinically normal calves not previously treated for BRD (Fig. 3a). There was, however,
a statistically significant increase (P = 0.0011) in the
abundance of P. multocida in the upper respiratory
tract of cattle at the time of MT-2 compared to the
untreated group at preconditioning processing (data
not shown). Unsurprisingly, systemic antibiotic therapy in calves likely altered the bacterial profile in the
upper respiratory tract of treated animals, as evidenced by the reduced prevalence (Fig. 3a) and abundance (Fig. 3b) of these bacteria in the URT at
preconditioning compared to untreated controls.
Anti-BCV serum antibody abundance measured over time
in cattle treated for BRD

Serum anti-BCV IgG antibodies were measured by
ELISA in 195 samples collected from birth through
weaning for 39 calves from Herd 2 that were involved
in the mass treatment for BRD on August 12, 2016
in order to determine the mean antibody abundance
and range at each sample acquisition time (Fig. 4).
The mean (± standard deviation) anti-BCV antibody
abundance declined from a maximum of 1186 ± 699
at birth to a low of 138 ± 88 at the time of mass treatment.
Mean antibody abundance increased slightly following
mass treatment, with mean antibody abundances of 176 ±
83 and 182 ± 95 at preconditioning and weaning,
respectively.
Neutralizing antibody titers were measured in 60 of
these samples from 12 randomly selected calves to determine the relationship between total anti-BCV reactive
antibodies measured by ELISA and neutralizing antibody
titers measured by a virus neutralization test (VNT).
The effect of altering the strain of the test virus used in
the VNT was also evaluated. A high positive mean correlation was observed between the ELISA and VNT
assays regardless of the test virus used (Pearson’s rank
correlation, ρ = 0.81 with BRCV_2014 strain and ρ = 0.91
with Mebus strain), indicating good to excellent agreement between the two tests under these conditions
(Additional file 2). Thus, the ELISA was used for subsequent measurements of anti-BCV antibodies.

Fig. 2 Prevalence and relative abundance of respiratory pathogens at the time of treatment for BRD. The prevalence and relative abundance of
respiratory pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of calves from Herd 2 was determined by RT-qPCR (BCV) or qPCR (bacterial pathogens) in 48
pools of nasal swabs from 234 calves treated for BRD. Numbers of positive and negative pools for each respiratory pathogen detected in nasal
swab specimens collected August 5 (MT-1) are shown in the first column (panels a, d, g, and j; 15 pools < 39.4 °C and 5 pools ≥39.4 °C) and
those collected on August 12 (MT-2) are shown in the second column (panels b, e, h, and k; 15 pools < 39.4 °C and 13 pools ≥39.4 °C). The third
column (panels c, f, i, and l) shows the cycle threshold (Ct) values for PCR positive pools. The Ct value is inversely associated with the amount of
pathogen RNA or DNA detected; therefore, the lower the Ct value, the greater the amount of pathogen specific nucleic acid was present in the
nasal swab specimen. A Ct < 40 was considered positive for all pathogens

Anti-BCV serum antibody abundance did not associate
with pre-weaning BRD incidence

To determine whether levels of passively acquired (maternal) antibodies were associated with pre-weaning
BRD incidence, relative anti-BCV antibody abundances
were measured in a subset of calves from each herd at
18–48 h after birth. Herds 1–3 had mean ± SD antibody
abundances of 473 ± 206, 1120 ± 571 and 868 ± 441, respectively. Thus, Herd 2 had the highest mean level of
passively acquired anti-BCV antibodies, but also the largest range of antibody titers (Fig. 5a).
Anti-BCV serum antibody levels were also measured
over time in 60 randomly selected study calves from
each herd at initial vaccination, preconditioning, and
weaning. The calves evaluated from Herd 3 had the
highest mean antibody abundance (489 ± 386) at initial
vaccination, which was significantly greater than Herd 1

(285 ± 117) but did not differ from Herd 2 (400 ± 222).
At preconditioning, Herd 2 had the highest mean antibody abundance (191 ± 89) that was significantly greater
than Herds 1 (148 ± 109) and 3 (138 ± 56). Herd 2 continued to have the highest mean antibody abundance at
weaning (163 ± 73), which was significantly greater than
Herds 1 (103 ± 78) and 3 (113 ± 52; Fig. 5a).
To determine whether anti-BCV antibody levels
were predictive for which individuals in Herd 2 would
develop signs of respiratory disease, antibody levels
from Figs. 4 and 5a were re-plotted to compare mean
antibody abundances between: a) those mass treated for
BRD with a rectal temperature ≥ 39.4 °C, b) those mass
treated for BRD with a rectal temperature < 39.4 °C, and c)
those from the same herd that remained untreated for
BRD throughout the study. No statistically significant difference in mean antibody abundance was observed within

sample acquisition times for these three groups (P = 0.48;
Fig. 5b). In summary, BCV antibody abundance was not
associated with pre-weaning BRD incidence within or
between herds.
Subclinical shedding of BCV was detected in all three
herds

Fig. 4 Anti-BCV antibody levels measured over time in calves
treated for BRD. Anti-BCV antibody levels were measured by ELISA in
39 calves from Herd 2 that were involved in mass treatment for BRD
on August 12, 2016 (MT-2). Differences in mean antibody abundance
were determined based on contrasts of least-squares means being
different from zero in models with sampling time as a fixed effect.
Sample collection times with the same superscript are not
significantly different (P > 0.05) in these contrasts

To evaluate pathogen exposure, subclinical respiratory
shedding of BCV as well as BHV-1, BRSV and BVDV
was measured in the 60 randomly selected calves from
each herd evaluated for anti-BCV antibody levels at initial vaccination, preconditioning and weaning. Bovine
viral diarrhea virus, BHV-1 and BRSV were not detected
in any calf at any sample acquisition time. Bovine coronavirus was detected in nasal secretions from two (3%),
10 (17%), and two (3%) of the 60 calves of Herds 1, 2,
and 3, respectively, at preconditioning; and one calf from
Herd 2 at weaning (Table 3). Thus, BCV was detected in
all three herds and shedding was highest at preconditioning processing, with an overall prevalence across
herds of 8% (14/180).
Of the 60 randomly selected calves from Herd 2, 45
were involved in one of the mass treatment events for
BRD and 15 were not. Seven of 45 (15.6%) calves that
were previously treated for BRD were shedding BCV at

Fig. 5 Relationship between anti-BCV antibody abundance and BRD. a Passively acquired immunity to BCV (maternal antibodies) was evaluated
in a subset of calves from each herd (n = 169, [herd 1 = 33; herd 2 = 82; herd 3 = 54]) by measuring the abundance of serum anti-BCV antibodies
in the calf at 18–48 h after birth. At initial vaccination, preconditioning and weaning, anti-BCV antibody levels were determined in serum samples
from 60 randomly selected calves from each herd to determine the mean and range of antibodies in each herd at each production stage. b AntiBCV antibody levels for calves from Herd 2 (from Figs. 4 and 5a) were re-plotted based on rectal temperature at the time of mass treatment for
BRD: those mass treated for BRD with a rectal temperature ≥ 39.4 °C (n = 14 at birth and 27 all other time points) and those mass treated for BRD
with a rectal temperature < 39.4 °C (n = 25 at birth and 49 at all other time points). These values were compared to those from animals of the
same herd that remained untreated for BRD (n = 42 at birth and 15 at all other time points). Differences in mean antibody abundance were
based on contrasts of least-squares means being different from zero in models with location and time as fixed effects (repeated measures);
contrasts were evaluated if the overall p value for location was significant. Herds with the same superscript were not significantly different (P >
0.05) in these contrasts

not previously treated for BRD were shedding BCV at
preconditioning. The one calf shedding BCV at weaning
was treated previously for BRD.
Anti-BCV antibody abundance did not associate with
respiratory shedding of BCV

To determine how serum anti-BCV antibody levels
related to respiratory BCV shedding, anti-BCV antibody levels from Fig. 5b were re-plotted to compare
antibody levels between those found to be shedding
BCV during the pre-weaning period and those that
were not. Within herds, claves found to be shedding
BCV at mass treatment, preconditioning, or weaning
did not have significantly different relative anti-BCV
antibody abundances compared to the rest of the
herd when measured at initial vaccination (prior to
when they shed BCV) or at preconditioning (Fig. 6).
At weaning, there was a trend for Herd 1, where the
calves that were shedding BCV at preconditioning
had among the highest anti-BCV antibody abundances; however, the sample size was extremely small
(n = 2). Therefore, there was no statistically significant
difference in the mean antibody abundance for those
found to be shedding BCV and those that were not
shedding BCV at each production stage.

Sequence analysis of the BCV spike gene

To compare the BCV strain(s) circulating in the three
herds, a fragment of the BCV spike gene spanning the
S1 hypervariable domain and antigenic domain II was
analyzed. Fifteen positive nasal swabs were analyzed: six
were from Herd 2 at the time of mass treatment (two
from 8/5/16 and four from 8/12/16), eight from preconditioning (two from Herd 1, four from Herd 2 and two
from Herd 3), and one from weaning (Herd 2). A total
of four SNPs (compared to the consensus) were identified in three samples, each leading to a change in the
predicted amino acid at that position (Table 4). Of these,
the first three amino acid changes are located within the
hypervariable domain and the last two are located in
antigenic domain II, which partially overlaps with the
hypervariable region [30].
BCV strains from two of the animals from Herd 2
were sequenced at two different sample acquisition
times. The BCV strain(s) infecting animal 2507 differed
by a single nucleotide between the two time points. In
contrast, the BCV strain(s) infecting animal 2830 was
identical at this location at both collection points. Furthermore, the strain present in Herd 2 was identical to
the strain in Herd 1 when comparing this region, and
only one or two SNPs were present in the strains circulating in Herd 3. Thus, the strains present in the three

similar strain during the course of the study.

Discussion
This study represents the first prospective longitudinal
study of the relationship between anti-BCV antibody
levels and BCV infections and respiratory disease in
nursing beef calves. Two outbreaks of respiratory disease
in one research herd resulted in two-thirds of the calves
being mass treated for BRD. BCV shedding was found to
occur in conjunction with the pre-weaning BRD outbreak.
However, when levels of passively or actively acquired
immunity to BCV were measured, they were not found to
associate with respiratory disease incidence between the
three study herds, nor with the development of BRD in
individual calves within that herd. Rather, BCV infections
were likely common, with many subclinical and some
persistent or recurrent infections detected.
The results from this study agree with the results from
previous studies in young dairy calves [16, 17]. In these
studies, dairy calves shed virus, sometimes repeatedly, in
spite of relatively high anti-BCV antibody titers. Furthermore, they observed no statistically significant correlation between maternal BCV specific IgG serum
antibody titers and clinical disease or infection by BCV

in that population [16]. Similarly, in the study reported
here, we found that BCV specific serum IgG did not correlate with respiratory disease; and 8/45 calves (18%)
from Herd 2 that were involved in mass treatment were
found to be shedding BCV at two or more sample acquisition times. This result supports the idea that persistent
or recurrent shedding episodes can occur in the same
animal with or without signs of disease.
BCV infection (as measured by virus shedding) was
similarly not found to be associated with anti-BCV
antibody levels; however, this measurement was hampered
by the infrequency of sample collection in our study design (Fig. 1). For example, nearly all of the animals in the
Herd 2 mass treatment groups shed BCV between our
routine sample collection times. While we did not see differences in anti-BCV antibody abundances in Herd 2 between those calves mass treated for BRD and those from
the same herd that remained untreated, it is possible, and
even likely, that many untreated calves also shed BCV between sample acquisition dates. Lack of BCV detection in
nasal swabs at routine collection times may lead to “false
negatives” for BCV infection that mask any influence antibodies may have on virus shedding. Furthermore, the
small number of BCV positive individuals found in Herds
1 and 3 (two calves from each herd were shedding BCV at
preconditioning processing) hinder our ability to detect
with any confidence differences that may exist. More

intensive sampling would be required to better determine
the association between anti-BCV antibody titers and
BCV infection. Other hypothetical reasons why serum
anti-BCV IgG abundance has not been found to associate
with BCV infection or treatment for disease has been
discussed previously [15, 16]. Among these is the lack of
knowledge related to the immune correlates of protection
for respiratory BCV infections. How cell mediated
immunity and other antibody isotypes (such as IgA)
contribute to protection from infection and disease are
areas that require additional research.
Given that BCV infection is common, it remains unknown why some animals display signs of respiratory
disease while others remain sub-clinically infected. To
determine whether there were differences in the BCV
strains circulating in the three herds, a 1102 nucleotide
fragment of spike gene was analyzed. The spike gene
encodes the surface glycoprotein that is responsible for
attachment to the host cell and is a major neutralizing
antigen targeted by the host immune system [34, 35].
The region of the spike gene spanning the hypervariable
region and antigenic domain II was selected because it is
variable between coronavirus strains and isolates, and
variations in this region have been associated with
altered antigenicity and/or pathogenicity in other species
[6]. No polymorphisms were found in this region
between Herd 1 and Herd 2 or between the isolates from
subclinical shedding episodes compared to the isolates
circulating at the time of the BRD outbreak. Furthermore, only one or two SNPs were found between the
isolates circulating in Herd 3 compared to the isolates in
Herds 1 and 2. In contrast, up to 35 SNPs and 11 amino
acid differences were detected in this same region when
these isolates were compared to 14 isolates collected
between 2014 and 2017 from USMARC and the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln Veterinary Diagnostic Center (unpublished data). Thus, differences in the BCV strains circulating
in the three herds are unlikely to account for the major differences in treatment rates observed in this study.
One side effect of respiratory viral infection is the
increased risk for bacterial superinfection [4]. While BCV
may occasionally produce a clinical syndrome consistent
with BRD in the absence of bacterial infection, its involvement, like other respiratory viruses, is generally considered to be a precursor to a bacterial infection, which
exacerbates disease [2, 4, 36]. Thus, the presence of co/
secondary bacterial infections may help explain the differences in disease severity in BCV-infected calves observed
in this study. Using qPCR to look at common bacterial
pathogens associated with respiratory disease in cattle, we
observed H. somni in high frequency and abundance in
the upper respiratory tract of sick cattle but not clinically
normal cattle from the same herd collected 2–3 weeks
after the outbreak. Furthermore, H. somni was not

Page 13 of 15

detected in these calves at initial vaccination, prior to the
disease outbreak. Thus, we hypothesize that a potential
secondary bacterial infection with H. somni may explain
why the cattle in Herd 2 displayed more signs of respiratory disease and subsequently required treatment. Of note,
however, within treatment groups there was no difference
in the relative abundance of H. somni in the nasal cavity of
animals when categorized by rectal temperature taken at
the time of sample collection and treatment. This suggests
that infection was widespread in the herd, though only
15–30% of the animals were displaying clinical signs of
disease at that particular time. Frequency differences of
various strains of these bacteria that have different propensities to cause disease may have been present between
these populations, but were not differentiated by the assays used. It is also possible that additional pathogens that
were not measured in this study could have contributed to
the disease outbreak. Thus, unbiased metagenomic
approaches are currently underway to determine whether
any additional viral or bacterial pathogens were associated
with the disease outbreak. How the URT microbiome may
have influenced respiratory health is also being examined
in these populations.

Conclusions
Co-detection of BCV and H. somni at the time of the
disease outbreak suggests that these two pathogens
contributed to disease pathogenesis. Characterizing the
factors that may have contributed to the outbreak
described here can help veterinarians, researchers, and
producers better understand the risk factors associated
with pre-weaning BRD. This information can be used to
guide prevention and control strategies to decrease the
incidence of BRD and associated adverse animal health
issues and production losses.
