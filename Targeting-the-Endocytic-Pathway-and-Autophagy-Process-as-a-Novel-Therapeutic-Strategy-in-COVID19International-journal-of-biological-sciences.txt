Abstract
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped, single-stranded positive genomic RNA viruses and some
of them are known to cause severe respiratory diseases in human, including Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the ongoing coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19). One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells. In the last
two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the
autophagy process in viral entry and replication. As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome
and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating
diseases caused by CoVs. In this mini-review, we will focus on the importance of the endocytic pathway
as well as the autophagy process in viral infection of several pathogenic CoVs inclusive of SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV and the new CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
and discuss the development of therapeutic agents by targeting these processes. Such knowledge will
provide important clues for control of the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment of
COVID-19.
Key words: Coronaviruses, endocytic pathway, autophagy, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19

Brief introduction of the new coronaviruses
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses
with a long single-stranded RNA ranging from 26 to
32 kilobases (kb) in size [1]. CoVs belong to the family
Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales, and have been
organised into 3 groups: α-CoVs, β-CoVs, and γ-CoVs
[2]. Two of the β-CoVs including severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) caused severe acute respiratory disease
outbreaks in China in 2002-2003 and in the Middle
East in 2012, respectively [3].
In December 2019, a novel CoV outbreak,
identified and named as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) started in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The SARS-CoV-2
spread very quickly in China and then to the many
other countries, causing coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19). The clinical futures of COVID-19 mainly
include fever, cough and pneumonia [4]. Up to date, it

has already infected more than 90,000 people
worldwide and killed more than three thousand
patients, mainly in Wuhan, China. SARS-Cov-2 shares
a high sequence identity (around 80%) with SARSCoV and a 96.2% sequence identity with BatCoV
RaTG13, a bat CoV [5]. Although some initial cases
were linked to a local seafood market in Wuhan, its
origin, intermediate hosts and how it was transmitted
to humans are still largely unknown [4].
In this mini-review, we will mainly focus on
β-CoV, which is inclusive of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,
and the current emerging SARS-CoV-2 to discuss the
implication of the endocytic pathway and autophagy
process in the infection of these pathogenic CoVs and
therapeutic potential of targeting these processes. This
review will also include the well-studied mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV) since it is often used as a safe
mode to study CoV infection.

Brief introduction of the autophagy and
the endocytic pathway
Macroautophagy or autophagy refers to an
evolutionarily conserved process in which the
intracellular components such as protein aggregates
and damaged organelles are engulfed into a
double-membrane structure called autophagosome,
which eventually fuses with lysosome to form
autolysosome for degradation [6, 7] (Figure 1). The
whole autophagy process is controlled by a group of
proteins encoded by autophagy-related-genes (ATGs)
in several consecutive stages [8, 9]. First, the induction
or initiation stage is controlled by the ULK1/Atg1
complex, downstream of the mechanistic target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Second, the
nucleation/expansion/elongation stage is mediated by
the ATG14-Beclin1-hVPS34/class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) complex, as well as the two
ubiquitin-like conjugation systems (ATG5-ATG12 and
LC3/ATG8). The third and last stage of autophagy is
the maturation/fusion/degradation in which autophagosome fuses with lysosome to form autolysosome
where the luminal contents are degraded (Figure 1).
At present, the biological functions of autophagy have
been extensively studied. Autophagy plays an
important role in various physiological and
pathological processes, including cell survival, cell
death, aging, immunity and metabolism [10, 11]. More
importantly, accumulating evidence has highlighted
the importance of autophagy in many human
diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,

1725
metabolic disorders, as well as immunity and
infection [12, 13]. Among them, the implication of
autophagy in viral infection has also been widely
investigated and deeply appreciated.
In the course of autophagy, lysosome plays an
essential role in the maturation/degradation stage of
autophagy, as the contents in the autophagosomes are
eventually
degraded
by
lysosomes,
via
autophagosome-lysosome fusion [14-16]. Lysosome,
first discovered by the Nobel laureate Christian de
Duve in the 1950s, is the most important digestive
organelle present in almost all eukaryotic cells and
with an array of important biological functions,
including endocytosis, exocytosis, macropinocytosis,
plasma membrane repair, defense against pathogens,
cell death, signal transduction, and autophagy [14,
17]. Lysosome is featured by its acidic internal pH
which is generated by the action of a V-ATPase, a
proton-pumping membrane protein complex [18].
Lysosome contains more than 50 acid hydrolases,
including proteases, peptidases, phosphatases,
nucleases, glycosidases, sulfatases, and lipases
designated for all types of macromolecules [19].
On the other hand, lysosome is also a key
component of the endocytic pathway, also termed as
the endolysosomal network [20] (Figure 1). In
addition to autophagy as described above, lysosome
receives cargos from other processes including
endocytosis through the endocytic pathway. Briefly,
following endocytosis, internalized cargos first enter
the early endosomes (EE) where the cargos are sorted
for two destinations: they are
either retrieved for recycling to
the plasma membrane/the secretory pathway, or are delivered to
the late endosome (LE) and then
fuse
with
lysosome
for
degradation [20, 21]. The main
biological functions of the
endocytic pathway are for
retrieval and recycling of
internalized cargo proteins, and
such functions are known to play
critical roles in the pathology of
important human diseases, in
particularly neurodegenerative
diseases and viral infection [22,
23].

Figure 1. Involvement of the endocytic pathway and autophagy in the entry and replication of CoVs in
host cells. Entry of CoVs into the host cells is mainly mediated by the endocytic pathway, meanwhile the autophagy has
also been implicated in the viral replication in the cells, a process partly related to the formation of DMV in the host cells.
As a result, several groups of inhibitors including the lysosomotropic agents such as CQ and inhibitors for
clathrin-mediated endocytosis such as chlorpromazine have been proposed to have therapeutic efficacy against
CoVs-induced diseases including COVID-19.

Implication of autophagy
in CoVs infection
In the past one and a half
decades, the implication of
autophagy in CoV infection has
attracted substantial attention,

probably due to the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 and
the emerging field of autophagy research at the same
period. At present, various reports have converged
onto two important questions: whether CoV induces
autophagy and whether the autophagy machinery or
ATG proteins are involved in the infection and
replication of CoVs. The first report demonstrating
the involvement of autophagy in viral replication was
based on MHV [24], in which the authors made
several important observations. First, MHV induced
the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs),
with resemblance to autophagosome, a hallmark of
autophagy. Second, the viral replication complexes at
DMVs co-localized with the autophagy proteins, LC3
and ATG12. Third and more importantly, MHV
replication was impaired in ATG5 knockout
embryonic stem cells. Therefore, the authors
concluded that autophagy is implicated in the
formation of DMV as well as in the replication of
MHV [24]. In a follow-up study, the same group also
examined the SARS-CoVs and found similar
colocalization of the key viral replication proteins
with endogenous LC3, a protein marker for
autophagosome [25], suggesting a similar function of
autophagy in the replication of SARS-CoVs. Cottam et
al used another CoV (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV)
and found that one of the key viral replicase protein
nsp6 is capable of inducing autophagy [26]. Notably,
this nsp6 also presents in MHV and SARS-CoV, and
thus it would be of interest to further test the effects of
nsp6 in these two CoVs on autophagy.
However, several subsequent studies have
challenged the notion that autophagy is implicated in
CoV infection. For instance, in Vero cells infected with
SARS-CoVs, Snijder et al failed to detect colocalization
of LC3 or GFP-LC3 with the viral replication-

transcription complexes of SARS-CoV examined
using immunofluorescence staining [27]. Further
studies also demonstrated that either ATG5 or ATG7,
two of the key autophagy proteins in control of
autophagosome biogenesis, is not required for viral
replication in cells infected by MHV [28, 29] or by
SARS-CoVs [30]. In those studies, cells with deletion
of either ATG5 or ATG7 failed to impair the viral
replication rate. Similarly, virus infection was not
inhibited by the knockdown of ATG5 [26]. Thus, all
these observations suggest that the autophagy
machinery is not directly implicated in the viral
replication process.
Intriguingly, there is evidence suggesting the
possible inhibitory effect of CoV on the autophagy
process. For instance, a study using SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV in HEK293T, HeLa and MCF-7 cells found
that overexpression of membrane-associated papainlike protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV led to blockage of autophagosomeslysosomes fusion and suppression of the autophagic
flux [31]. Consistently, a more recent report found
that MERS-CoV blocks the fusion of autophagosomes
and lysosomes and induction of autophagy reduces
the replication of MERS-CoV [32]. Thus, it appears
that there is certain type of interplay between the
autophagy machinery and CoVs, and the exact nature
of such interaction remains to be further elucidated.
Taken together, as summarized in Table 1, it is
still controversial whether and how autophagy is
implicated in the infection of CoVs. The discrepancies
in the literature is probably due to the different
viruses used, different cells tested and even the
different techniques used in study of autophagy.
More work is thus needed to clarify those important
issues.

Involvement of the endocytic pathway in
CoVs infection
One of the key determining factors in viral
infection is the entry of the virus into the host cells. At
present, it is widely believed that CoVs enter the host
cells via two routes: (i) the endocytic pathway and (ii)
non-endosomal pathway [33], as partly illustrated in
Figure 1. Among them, the endocytic pathway is
considered to be particularly important and has been
extensively studied. As discussed earlier, CoVs are
enveloped and plus-strand RNA virus and they
contain a set of four proteins that encapsidate the viral
genomic RNA: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the
membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope protein (E),
and the spike glycoprotein (S) [34]. Among them, the
function of the S protein is mainly involved in the
process of viral entry into the host cells via proteolytic
cleavage to form two subunits, S1 and S2 [35]. These
two subunits have distinct functions: S1 is responsible
for receptor-binding, while S2 is mainly for
membrane fusion and both are essential for viral entry
via the endocytic pathway and infection into the host
cells.
The first report showing the relevance of
endosome-lysosome in CoVs was from a

morphological study in which two CoVs (IBV and
Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV)) were found
to accumulate in the lysosomes of cells after infection
[36], indicating that the possible functional
implication of lysosome in CoVs infection.
Subsequent studies have firmly established that the
endocytic pathway is the key mechanisms controlling
the entry of CoVs into the host cells, and thus the
endocytic pathway has been widely investigated as
the target of anti-viral therapies, as summarized in
Table 2.
Among all these studies, there are several
important points to be highlighted. First, different
CoVs including MHV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
have been consistently demonstrated to engage the
endocytic pathway as the main mechanism for viral
entry into a variety types of host cells. Among them,
clathrin-dependent endocytosis and cathepsinmediated S protein cleavage are two critical steps for
the viral entry and infection. In fact, this mechanism is
also applicable to many other CoVs such as IBV [37],
which is out of the scope of this review.
Second, despite the general understanding for
the role of the endocytic pathway for viral entry, there
are discrepancies of the exact mechanisms among
http://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
different reports even with the same CoV. For
instance, Wang et al found that SARS-CoVs engage
clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytic
pathway as the key mechanism for viral entry [38],
which is inconsistent with an earlier report in which
SARS-CoV entry into HepG2 cells is mostly mediated
by the clathrin-dependent pathway [39]. Part of the
reason for such discrepancies is the different cell types
used in their studies, as shown in Table 2. Therefore,
it is possible that the exact nature of the entry is
context-dependent, including the type of the virus
and the type of the cells.
Third, at present, the entry mechanisms and the
implication of the endocytic pathway of the new
emerging SARS-CoV-2 have not been reported
directly. It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the
same receptor of SARS-CoV, which is angiotensin
converting enzyme II (ACE2) for viral entry into the
host cells [5, 40]. ACE2 transcripts was originally only
found in heart, kidney and testis of human [41].
However, it was later found that ACE2 protein
expresses abundantly in the epithelia of the human
lung and small intestine [42]. Since SARS-CoV-2 also
binds to the same ACE2 receptor as SARS-CoV [5] and
SARS-CoV-2 is also susceptible to the inhibitory effect
of chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic agent [43], it is
highly possible that this new CoV utilizes the same
endocytic pathway for entry into the host cells.
Understanding this mechanism is important in the
search of effective therapeutic agents in the treatment
of COVID-19 caused by this new CoV.
Finally, in almost all the studies listed in Table 2,
different inhibitors of the endocytic pathway have
been used in blocking viral entry and infection.
Among them, three groups of inhibitors are believed
to be particularly important and clinically relevant.
The first group are the lysosomotropic agents which
are capable of accumulating inside and neutralizing
the endosome-lysosomal acidic pH and thus blocking
the protease activity to inhibit the viral entry. In this
group, CQ is an ancient anti-malaria drug and
clinically available, as shown in Figure 1. The second
group are direct endosomal-lysosomal protease
inhibitors such as E64d. And the third group are
inhibitors for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis such
as chlorpromazine, which is also clinically available
(Figure 1). The details of such inhibitors are to be
discussed in the section below.
Taken together, establishing the role of endocytic
pathway in viral entry is a major breakthrough in the
mechanistic understanding of the CoVs infection,
which offers great opportunity in development of
novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of diseases
such as SARS and COVID-19.

1728

Targeting the endocytic pathway and
autophagy as a novel therapeutic strategy
against CoVs
Lysosomotropic agents targeting endosomal/
lysosomal pH
CQ, a well-known anti-malarial drug, is
probably the most well-studied lysosomotropic agent
that accumulates in the acidic organelles such as
endosomes and lysosomes and neutralizes their pH
[57]. At present, it has been well studied that CQ has a
wide-spectrum of anti-viral effects including
anti-CoVs, anti-HIV, and anti-type A and B influenza
viruses [58]. The anti-viral effects of CQ and its
analogs have been reviewed elsewhere [59]. Here we
would like to focus on the effect of CQ on CoVs, as
summarized in Table 2. For instance, CQ has been
shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro via a
screening of an FDA-approved compound library
[60]. Treatment with CQ at a clinically relevant concentration, either before or after SARS-CoV infection
into the Vero E6 cells, was found to be effective in
suppressing viral infection, indicating its application
in both prophylactic and therapeutic conditions [47].
Similar results were also found in another
lysosomotropic agent, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)
[47]. It is known that the cleavage of the Spike
Glycoprotein (S protein) by proteases is required for
the SARS-CoV entry to the cells via a pH-dependent
manner [45]. Mechanistically, it is believed that the
neutralization of endo-lysosomal pH by CQ inhibits
the protease activities and prevents the cleavage of S
protein and subsequently impairs the viral entry into
the host cell. Interestingly, Wang et al showed that in
cells treated with CQ, NH4Cl or Bafilomycin A1 (an
endo/lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor), the viral
receptor ACE2 was trapped within perinuclear
vacuoles [38], suggesting that these lysosomotropic
agents may also affect the function of ACE2. Since
ACE2 serves as the viral receptor for both SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2, such observations further support
the notion for the potent anti-viral activity of those
lysosomotropic agents. Indeed, a very recent study
showed that CQ inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection at
both entry and post-entry stages in Vero E6 cells [43].
In addition to its direct effects on CoVs, there is
evidence of the combinational activity of CQ with
other therapeutic agents for treatment of SARS, MERS
and possibly COVID-19. For instance, He et al
reported that CQ has synergistic effect on
glucocorticoid signaling by stabilizing glucocorticoid
receptor [61]. Since glucocorticoid is one of the
recommended therapy for severe SARS patients [62],
it is possible that CQ may can be used for treatment of
COVID-19 in combination of glucocorticoids and
http://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
clinical trials are thus needed to test the efficacy of
such combined therapy.
At present, CQ phosphate has been listed as a
new therapeutic in the sixth version of “Guidelines for
the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of
COVID-19” issued by the National Health
Commission of the People's Republic of China. And a
number of clinical trials with CQ have been initiated
in China [63]. The current suggested dosage of CQ for
COVID-19 is as high as 500 mg, with treatment not
exceeding 10 days. However, the usage of CQ
phosphate should be evaluated carefully as it may
also have side effects such as retinopathy [64] and
cautions should be taken for close monitoring of the
potential side effect throughout the whole treatment
period. The dosage should be reduced or stopped if
reduction in haemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte
count and platelet count, or the eyesight are observed.
In addition, since CQ is the substrate of cytochrome
P450 (CYP) enzymes which are responsible for the
metabolism of multiple drugs, it might interfere with
other medications such as digitoxin (a cardiac
glycoside) and tamoxifen (used for treatment of breast
cancer). More details of the toxicity and precautious of
CQ can be referred elsewhere [65].

Endosomal-lysosomal protease inhibitors
Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal
cysteine proteases that play important roles in protein
degradation in various cellular processes including
both the endocytic pathway and autophagy [64]. The
role of cathepsins in viral infection was first identified
by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine
proteases inhibitor E64d and a specific cathepsin L
inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK are able to block the
SARS-CoV infection [48]. K11777 is another cysteine
protease inhibitor that has been reported to block the
entry of SARS-CoV at the sub-nanomolar range [66].
In addition, teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic and
its derivatives inhibit the entry of MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV by inhibition of cathepsin L activity [55].
Interestingly, a serine protease inhibitor camostat was
known to inhibit transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2) and effectively protected the mice against
death caused by SARS-CoV infection [55]. More
importantly, a very recent study showed that
camostat can also block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by
inhibiting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [67]. Since camostat is
already in clinical use for the treatment of chronic
pancreatitis, suggesting its therapeutic potential for
treatment of COVID-19.

Inhibitors for clathrin-mediated endocytosis
As
discussed
earlier,
clathrin-mediated
endocytosis is one of the key mechanisms for viral

1729
entry into the host cells, including MHV [50, 52, 54],
SARS-CoV [38], and MERS-CoV [53, 54]. Therefore,
chlorpromazine, an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent
endocytosis, have been consistently found to possess
significant inhibitory effect on the entry of those CoVs
[39]. In fact, chlorpromazine is a FDA-approved drug
widely used for treatment of psychotic disorders such
as schizophrenia [68]. Importantly, it has been well
established for its antivirus function for many types of
viruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs, as
summarized in Table 2. At present, the clinical
application of chlorpromazine in treatment of SARS
and MERS has not been reported and it would be of
interest to conduct clinical trials for testing the
therapeutic effect of chlorpromazine on COVID-19.
In addition, two cardiotonic steroids ouabain
and bufalin, selective inhibitors of the plasma
membrane Na+/K+-ATPase, have been shown to
inhibit the MERS-CoV infection at nanomolar
concentrations via affecting the clathrin-mediated
endocytosis pathway [54]. Since both of them are also
FDA-approved drugs and clinically available, it
would be of interest to test them clinically for
treatment of COVID-19.

Summary and perspectives
The current ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2
and COVID-19 worldwide has emerged as a
significant global public health threat. While urgent
regulatory measures in control of the rapid spread of
this virus are essential, scientists around the world
have quickly engaged in this battle by studying the
molecular mechanisms and searching for effective
therapeutic strategies against this deadly disease. At
present, while the exact role of autophagy remains
debatable, there is overwhelming evidence suggesting
that the endocytic pathway plays a key role in
mediating viral entry for many CoVs including
SARS-CoVs, MERS-CoVs and possibly SARS-CoV-2.
As a result, several inhibitors targeting the endocytic
pathway appear to have the therapeutic potential in
treatment of COVID-19, including a lysosomotropic
agent CQ and a clathrin-mediated endocytosis
inhibitor chlorpromazine [43, 63, 65, 68]. Since both
are FDA-approved and clinically available, clinical
trials either as a single therapy or in combination with
other anti-viral drugs are much needed.

Competing Interests
The authors have declared that no competing
interest exists.
