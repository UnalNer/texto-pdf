Background Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe. People of all ages are susceptible
to COVID-19. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited.
Methods To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family
members were described.
Results The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had
normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had
travel histories to Hubei Province.
Conclusions Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected
children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition,
early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.

Since the outbreak of the coronovirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China, a total of 82,488 confirmed cases have been reported globally as of February
27, 2020 [1]. Of these cases, 78,824 were from China and 3664 were from 46 other countries [1]. Among the confirmed cases, 2788 died in China and 57 died in other countries [1]. The novel coronavirus has been named severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
whereas the disease associated with it is referred to as
COVID-19 [2].
A series of recent published articles have reported the
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the hospitalized patients in Wuhan with COVID-19 [3–5]. Most
patients reported in the literature were adults, and adult
patients commonly presented as pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT [3–6]. Elderly men with comorbidities were more likely to exacerbate with severe and
even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) [3–5]. The Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention reported 72,314
COVID-19 patients as of February 11, 2020. Among the
44,672 confirmed cases, 416 cases were aged 0–10 years
[7]. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are
limited [8, 9]. Herein, we report two children with confirmed COVID-19 from two family clusters. This paper
will help pediatricians early recognize pedaitric cases with
COVID-19.
