The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency
of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed
to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric
symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China
to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the
initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From
31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.
The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days,
contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures
against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological
impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was
assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210
respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of
the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8%
reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.
Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members
contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available
(75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza),
and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of
the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and
accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary
measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact
of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During
the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the
psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.
Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental
health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health
of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China is a global health threat [1], and is by
far the largest outbreak of atypical pneumonia since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreak in 2003. Within weeks of the initial outbreak the total number of cases and deaths exceeded
those of SARS [2]. The outbreak was first revealed in late December 2019 when clusters of pneumonia
cases of unknown etiology were found to be associated with epidemiologically linked exposure to
a seafood market and untraced exposures in the city of Wuhan of Hubei Province [3]. Since then,
the number of cases has continued to escalate exponentially within and beyond Wuhan, spreading to
all 34 regions of China by 30 January 2020. On the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern [4].
COVID-19, similarly to SARS, is a beta-coronavirus that can be spread to humans through
intermediate hosts such as bats [5], though the actual route of transmission is still debatable.
Human-to-human transmission has been observed via virus-laden respiratory droplets, as a growing
number of patients reportedly did not have animal market exposure, and cases have also occurred in
healthcare workers [6]. Transmissibility of COVID-19 as indicated by its reproductive number has been
estimated at 4.08 [7], suggesting that on average, every case of COVID-19 will create up to 4 new cases.
The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 has been considered to have increased 21-fold in comparison
to the situation in the first half of January 2020 [8]. The average incubation period is estimated to
be 5.2 days, with significant variation among patients [9], and it may be capable of asymptomatic
spread [10,11]. Symptoms of infection include fever, chills, cough, coryza, sore throat, breathing
difficulty, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [12]. Older men with medical comorbidities are
more likely to get infected, with worse outcomes [12]. Severe cases can lead to cardiac injury, respiratory
failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death [13]. The provisional case fatality rate by WHO
is around 2%, but some researchers estimate the rate to range from 0.3% to 0.6% [14].
Since the outbreak, response efforts by the China government have been swift, and three weeks
into the epidemic, in an unprecedented move to retard the spread of the virus, a lockdown was
imposed on Wuhan on 23 January, with travel restrictions. Within days, the quarantine was extended
to additional provinces and cities, affecting more than 50 million people in total. Many stayed at
home and socially isolated themselves to prevent being infected, leading to a “desperate plea” [15].
There have also been accounts of shortages of masks and health equipment. The ongoing COVID-19
epidemic is inducing fear, and a timely understanding of mental health status is urgently needed for
society [16]. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on
people at the individual, community, and international levels during outbreaks of infection. On an
individual level, people are likely to experience fear of falling sick or dying themselves, feelings of
helplessness, and stigma [17]. During one influenza outbreak, around 10% to 30% of general public
were very or fairly worried about the possibility of contracting the virus [18]. With the closure of
schools and business, negative emotions experienced by individuals are compounded [19]. During the
SARS outbreak, many studies investigated the psychological impact on the non-infected community,
revealing significant psychiatric morbidities which were found to be associated with younger age and
increased self-blame [20]. Those who were older, of female gender, more highly educated, with higher
risk perceptions of SARS, a moderate anxiety level, a positive contact history, and those with SARS-like
symptoms were more likely to take precautionary measures against the infection [21].
Currently, there is no known information on the psychological impact and mental health of
the general public during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. This is especially pertinent with the
uncertainty surrounding an outbreak of such unparalleled magnitude. Based on our understanding,
most of the research related to this outbreak focuses on identifying the epidemiology and clinical
characteristics of infected patients [6,12], the genomic characterization of the virus [22], and challenges
for global health governance [23]. However, there are no research articles examining the psychological
impact on COVID-19 on the general population in China.
Therefore, this present study represents the first psychological impact and mental health survey
conducted in the general population in China within the first two weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak.
This study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective
factors contributing to psychological stress. This may assist government agencies and healthcare
professionals in safeguarding the psychological wellbeing of the community in the face of COVID-19
outbreak expansion in China and different parts of the world.
