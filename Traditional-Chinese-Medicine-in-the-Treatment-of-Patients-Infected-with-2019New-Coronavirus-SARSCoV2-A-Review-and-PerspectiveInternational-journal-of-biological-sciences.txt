Abstract
Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as
2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across
China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus
drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care
and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At
the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are
receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are
thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are
analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the
beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.
Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect
of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity
are also introduced.
Key words: SARS-CoV-2, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronavirus pneumonia

Introduction
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of
unexplainable pneumonia in Wuhan city, Hubei
province, China [1]. By Jan 7, 2020, it was confirmed
that a new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2
(formerly named as 2019-nCoV) had emerged [2]. The
World Health Organization (WHO) named the
Wuhan pneumonia as Coronavirus Disease-2019
(COVID-19) on Feb 11, 2020 [3]. The COVID-19
patients showed typical respiratory symptom (such as
cough, fever, and lung damage) and some other
symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea [4,
5]. As of February 17, 2020, a total of 73,332 cases of
the SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia has been
reported in China and 25 other countries, of which
72,528 cases was found in China [6]. Due to the rapid

spread of SARS-CoV-2 through human-to-human
transmission, the cases currently continue to rise.
SARS-CoV-2 extracted from patients with pneumonia
in Wuhan is an enveloped single stranded RNA-type
beta-coronavirus [7]. The genome sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 shared 79.5% sequence identity to severe
acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses
(SARS-CoV) [8, 9]. In addition, the spike (S) protein of
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enters human alveolar
epithelial cells through binding angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [8].
COVID-19 can be diagnosed by either chest CT
radiography or a laboratory testing. Unfortunately,
specific antiviral drugs or vaccines currently have not
been available for the treatment [10, 11]. According to
http://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
the current clinical guideline in China and the
experiences in the treatment of SARS or Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients, both
conventional medicine and traditional Chinese
medicine (TCM) are used for the treatment of patients
with infection of SARS-CoV-2 in China [12-14]. This
review mainly focuses on the discussion of TCM
usage in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, in the
context of current conventional management. Due to
the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and
pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [8,
9], and widely usage of TCM in the treatment of
patients infected with SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 [15],
the clinical evidence showing the efficacy and safety
of TCM in the treatment of patients with the emerging
coronaviral will be summarized and analyzed,
including the laboratory studies that provide an
insight into molecular basis of therapeutic benefits.

Conventional treatment of SARS-CoV-2:
is there a room for Chinese medicine?
Due to the absence of a specific antiviral
therapeutics and vaccine, main treatment strategy for
COVID-19 is supportive care, which is supplemented
by the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics,
antivirals, corticosteroids and convalescent plasma
[16] (Table 1). HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and
lopinavir have been used, typically in combination
with appropriate antibiotics or with IFNα-2b, in the
treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [7, 17].
Nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin [12] may be
potentially beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19,
since ribavirin was approved for treating respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) infection [18] and used
extensively during the SARS and MERS outbreak [10].
However, ribavirin had severe side effects such as
anemia [18] and whether it had sufficient antiviral
activity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Nucleoside
analogs favipiravir (T-705) can effectively inhibit the
activity of RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as
influenza [19]. A recent in vitro study found that it had
the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [20], but the in vivo effect
remains elusive. Remdesivir may be the most
promising antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. It has
in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against a wide
array of RNA viruses including SARS and MERS [21],
and could decrease viral loads and pathology of lungs
in animal models [22]. A study showed remdesivir
markedly inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in
Vero E6 cells [20], and most symptoms of the first US
patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 had resolved
swiftly after intravenous administration with
remdesivir [23]. Currently, it is under clinical trial to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous
remdesivir for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection

1709
[24]. Oral oseltamivir has been used for the treatment
of the cases with SARS-CoV-2 [7], while its efficacy
currently remains uncertain.

Host-targeted small molecules approved for
other human diseases may modulate the virus-host
interactions of SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine, a potential
broad-spectrum antiviral drug [25, 26], was shown by
a recent study had anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [20]. Its
clinical efficacy is under study in an open-label trial
(ChiCTR2000029609) [12]. IFNα (5 million U)
atomization inhalation was recommended as antiviral
therapy to treat SARS-CoV-2 [16]. A trial testing
IFNα-2b combination of the approved anti-HCV
inhibitors has been initiated [17], however, whether it
could act synergistically against SARS-CoV-2 is
unclear.
Corticosteroids were frequently used to suppress
the elevated cytokine levels in patients with
SARS-CoV [27, 28] and MERS-CoV [29, 30]. However,
there are no evidence showing that the mortality of
SARS and MERS patients was reduced by the
treatment with corticosteroids, while the clearance of
viral was delayed by such treatment [31-33].
Consequently, corticosteroids are not suggested to
systemically use in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [34,
35].
Previously, it was shown that, either in severe
influenza or SARS-CoV infection, convalescent
plasma treatment could significantly decrease viral
load and reduce the mortality [31, 36]. Convalescent
plasma has been used for severe SARS-CoV-2
infection in China [22], although promising, the
efficacy and safety need to be carefully further
evaluated.
Consistent with previous analysis, WHO also
concluded "to date, there is no specific medicine

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
recommended to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2" [37].
TCM has been used in control of infectious diseases
for thousands of years. There is a clear room for the
intervention of TCM as a complementary therapy for
COVID-19 patients. It is reported that the patients
with SARS-CoV infection have benefited from TCM
treatment [38], including amelioration of side effect of
conventional therapeutics [39, 40]. Based on these
factors, there is a general expectation that TCM would
be a valuable weapon in the armory against
SARS-CoV-2.

Traditional Chinese Medicine in the
treatment of patients infected with
SARS-CoV: clinical evidence
Application of TCM in the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 is largely inspired by the treatment of
SARS caused by outbreak of SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) in the late of 2002 in the Guangdong
Province of China which spread rapidly during the
2003, with the cumulative number worldwide of over
8,000 [41-43]. Ranging from case reports, case series,
controlled observational studies and randomized
clinical trials, clinical studies aiming to examine the
effect of TCM on SARS have been carried out and
reported. There are quite compelling evidences
support the notion that TCM has beneficial effect in
the treatment or prevention of SARS. For example, the
rate of fatality in Hong Kong and Singapore was
approximately 18%, while the rate for Beijing was
initially more than 52% until the 5th of May and
decreased gradually to 4%-1% after the 20th of May in
2003. The dramatic reduced fatality from late May in
Beijing was believed to be associated with the use of
TCM as a supplement to the conventional therapy
[44]. Lau and colleagues reported that, during SARS
outbreak, 1063 volunteers including 926 hospital
workers and 37 laboratory technicians working in
high-risk virus laboratories used a TCM herbal
extract, namely Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San.
Compared with the 0.4% of infection in the control
group, none of TCM users infected. Furthermore,
there was some evidence that Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping
Feng San could modulate T cells in a manner to
enhance host defense capacity [45, 46]. In a controlled
clinical study, the supplementary treatment with
TCM resulted in marked improvement of symptoms
and shortened the disease course [47]. The clinical
beneficial effect of TCM appears to be supported by
laboratory studies. For example, a high-profile
research published in the Lancet reported that
glycyrrhizin, a major active constituent liquorice root
which is the most frequently used Chinese herb,
potently inhibited the replication of clinical isolates of
SARS virus [48]. Another independent study

1710
confirmed the antivirus activity of glycyrrhizin by
plaque reduction assays and this study found that
another Chinese herbal compound baicalin also had
the anti-SARS activity [49]. Furthermore, Wang et al.
found MOL376, a compound derived from TCM, may
become a lead compound for SARS therapy by
inhibition of cathepsin L, a target for the treatment of
SARS [50].
There is a myriad of literature on TCM
treatments for SARS published after the SARS
epidemic in China. A critical analysis of these
publications would be useful to confirm the beneficial
effect of TCM. Liu et al. systematically reviewed eight
randomized controlled trials, and concluded that, by
combination with conventional medicine, TCM
showed the beneficial effects such as decrease of
mortality and relief of symptom, as well as control of
fungal infections in patients with SARS. However, the
evidence is not sufficient enough due to the poor
quality of methodology used in the trials [13]. Leung
analyzed 90 peer-reviewed papers with reasonable
quality from 130 publications and concluded that
TCM used together with conventional treatment had
some positive effects, including better control of fever,
quicker clearance of chest infection and other
symptoms. However, such beneficial effect of TCM is
not conclusive and more high-quality clinical studies
are required [15]. In another thorough literature
analysis, Liu and colleagues concluded that there was
no benefit of adjuvant treatment with TCM in terms of
mortality [39]. Due to the lack of high quality TCM
trials and biases that influenced the validity of results,
Wu and colleagues suggested to re-run clinical trials
of TCM for the treatment of acute respiratory tract
infections (ARTIs) [51].

Identification of anti-novel coronaviral
compound from Traditional Chinese
Medicine
Natural products used in TCM remains to be a
wealthy source for the identification of novel
therapeutic agents for the treatment of human
diseases [52]. In the past decade, scientists have made
a considerable effort to identify multiple component
herbal formulae in TCM with anti-SARS-CoV activity
(Table 2). Further identification of chemical entities
contained in TCM herbs responsible for the
anti-SARS- CoV effect was also pursued (Table 3).
Due to the homology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
these previous studies may shed light on the naturally
occurring compounds with the capacity to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2.
3- chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is vital
for replication of virus, and thus represents a
promising drug target for the development of

therapeutics agents for SARS-CoV as well as other
human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. It was
reported that following TCM herbal extracts had the
capacity to inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS
3CLpro: Chinese Rhubarb extracts (IC50: 13.76 ± 0.03
μg/mL) [53], water extract of Houttuynia cordata [54,
55], flavonoid extracted from litchi seeds [56] and
beta-sitosterol (IC50: 1210µM) extracted from the root
extract of Isatis indigotica [57]. Further, following
herb-derived
naturally
occurring
compounds

including sinigrin (IC50: 217µM), indigo (IC50:
752µM), aloe-emodin (IC50: 366 µM), hesperetin
(IC50:8.3 µM) [57], quercetin (IC50: 73µM),
epigallocatechin gallate (IC50: 73µM), gallocatechin
gallate (IC50: 47 µM) [58], herbacetin, rhoifolin and
pectolinarin [59] were able to inhibit the SARS 3CLpro
activity. Moreover, the flavonoids namely herbacetin,
isobavaschalcone, quercetin 3‐β‐D‐glucoside, and
helichrysetin had the potential to block the enzymatic
activity of MERS‐CoV 3CL protease [60].

The helicase protein is also considered as a
potential target for the development of anti-HCoV
(human coronavirus) agents. Yu et al. reported
scutellarein and myricetin potently inhibited the
nsP13 (SARS-CoV helicase protein) in vitro by
affecting the ATPase activity [61]. The RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme
responsible for both positive and negative-strand
RNA synthesis, also represents another potential
druggable target. It was shown that the extracts of
Kang Du Bu Fei Tang (IC50:471.3 µg/mL), Sinomenium
acutum (IC50:198.6 µg/mL), Coriolus versicolor
(IC50:108.4 µg/mL) and Ganoderma lucidum (IC50:41.9
µg/mL) inhibited SARS-CoV RdRp in a dosedependent manner [54]. Wu et al. performed largescale screening of existing drugs, natural products,
and synthetic compounds (>10000 compounds) to
identify effective anti-SARS-CoV agents through a
cell-based assay with SARS virus and Vero E6 cells
[62]. They found that ginsenoside-Rb1 isolated from
Panax ginseng, aescin isolated from the horse chestnut
tree, reserpine contained in the genus Rauwolfia and
extracts of eucalyptus and Lonicera japonica inhibited
SARS-CoV replication at non-toxic concentrations
[62].
Same as SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63,
SARS-CoV-2 uses host receptor ACE2 for the cellular
entrance [63-66]. Therefore, TCM with the capacity to
target ACE2 holds the promise to prevent the
infection of SARS-CoV-2. Emodin from genus Rheum
and Polygonum [67], baicalin from in Scutellaria
baicalensis [44, 68], nicotianamine from foodstuff
(especially “soybean ACE2 inhibitor (ACE2iSB)”) [69],
scutellarin [70], tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (TGG)
from Galla chinensis and luteolin from Veronicalina
riifolia [71] markedly inhibited the interaction of
SARS-CoV S-protein and ACE2. However, the
anti-SARS-CoV activity of these compounds remain to
be evaluated. In addition, inhibition of the 3a ion
channel by emodin [72] or kaempferol derivativesjuglanin [73] could potentially prevent the viral
release from the infected cells. Saikosaponins [74],
glycyrrhizin [48, 75], quercetin and TSL-1 extracted
from Toona sinensis Roem [76] purportedly had potent
anti-SARS-CoV effects by inhibition of viral cellular
entry, adsorption, and penetration.
Overwhelming inflammatory responses are
attributable to the deaths of patients with infection of
SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV, or COVID-19. Thus,
anti-inflammatory agents presumably could reduce
the severity and mortality rate [77]. Shuang Huang
Lian, a TCM herbal product prepared from Lonicerae
japonicae Flos, Scutellariae radix and Fructus Forsythiae,
purportedly had the activity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
[78]. Interestingly, We have shown that this herbal

1712
preparation potently inhibited staphylococcal toxic
shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1)-induced production
of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ) and
chemokines (MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MCP-1) by
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) [79]. In
line with our results, this herbal product was shown
to markedly reduced the transcriptional and
translational levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α,
IL-1β, and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
murine alveolar macrophages [80]. Indirubin is an
active ingredient of a TCM preparation Dang Gui Long
Hui Pill, had strong antiviral and immunomodulatory
effects, as shown by a study based on the observation
of
influenza
H5N1
virus-infected
human
macrophages and type-I alveolar epithelial cells [81].
Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule was reported to have in
vitro activity in inhibition of propagation of various
influenza viruses. This TCM herbal product not only
blocked the early stages of influenza virus infection
but also inhibited virus-induced gene expression of
IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, IP-10, and MCP-1 [82]. Additionally,
a study by Dong et al. reported that the levels of IL-8,
TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-23 in the sputum and of IL-8 and
IL-17 in the blood were markedly decreased after Lian
Hua Qing Wen Capsule treatment in patients with acute
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease [83]. A self-control study by Poon et al.
showed that the administration of the TCM herbal
formulas (Sang Ju Yin and Yu Ping Feng San) may have
beneficial immunomodulatory effects for the
prevention of viral infections including SARS-CoV
[46].
Moreover, a number of anti-coronaviral agents
have been identified from TCM herbs, although the
mechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated.
For example, extracts from Lycoris radiata, Artemisia
annua, Pyrrosia lingua, and Lindera aggregate possessed
the anti–SARS-CoV activity [84], 3β-Friedelanol
isolated from Euphorbia neriifolia [85], Blancoxanthone
isolated from the roots of Calophyllum blancoi [86]
exhibited anti-HCoV-229E activity.

Traditional Chinese Medicine used in the
treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients: the current situations
TCM is highly valued by the government of
China in their campaign to contain and eradiate
SARS-CoV-2. For example, Health Commission in 26
provinces have officially declared that TCM should be
used in combination with conventional medicine in
the treatment of COVID-19 patients. On 17, February,
National Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s
Republic of China reported that 60,107 confirmed
COVID-19 patients (85.20% of total confirmed cases)
had been treated with TCM [87]. As for March 1, 2020,
http://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
a total of 303 ongoing clinical trials aiming to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of treatments for CoV-19
patients have been launched in China. Among them,
50 trials (16.5%) are about the use of TCM, including
14 cases (4.6%) to examine the effect of combined
treatment with TCM and Western medicine. In 22
TCM trials (7.3%), the effect of self-made herbal
preparations such as Xin Guan-1 Formula, Xin Guan-2
Formula and Qing Yi-4 are examined. In another 14
TCM trials (4.6%), commercially available TCM
products such as Tan Re Qing Injection and Lian Hua
Qing Wen Capsule are studied (Table 4).
To date, NHC has published 6 editions
Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19
[88]. Since the fourth versions, different herbal
medicines used in TCM system has been
recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, based
on the stage of disease and symptom differentiation
[89]. According to the latest edition of Guideline [88],
following multiple component Chinese herbal
products are recommended for the patients in the
medical observation period, presumably as a
preventive measure: Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui, Lian
Hua Qing Wen Capsule, Shu Feng Jie Du Capsule and Jin
Hua Qing Gan Granule. In the clinical treatment period,
Qing Fei Pai Du Tang, Xi Yan Ping Injection, Xue Bi Jing
injection, Re Du Ning Injection, Tan Re Qing Injection,

1713
Xing Nao Jing Injection and some other Chinese
medicine formulae should be selected [90]. In
addition, for the patients in critical condition, Shen Fu
Injection, Sheng Mai Injection, Shen Mai Injection, Su He
Xiang Pill and An Gong Niu Huang Pill should be
administered (Table 5).
Through analysis of the frequency of TCM used
in 23 provinces, Luo, et al. [37] concluded that
Astragalus membranaceus, Glycyrrhizae uralensis,
Saposhnikoviae
divaricata,
Rhizoma
Atractylodis
Macrocephalae, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Fructus forsythia,
Atractylodis Rhizoma, Radix platycodonis, Agastache
rugosa, and Cyrtomium fortune J. Sm were 10 most
commonly used Chinese herbs in the treatment of
COVID-19. Xu, et al. [91] reported that Astragalus
membranaceus and Yu Ping Feng were used in the 13
prevention programs (in Beijing, Tianjin, et al.) for
“reinforcing vital qi”, a terminology used in TCM that
is similar to boosting host defense capacity.
Ophiopogon japonicas and Scrophularia ningpoensisand
are TCM herbs which were most frequently used for
“nourishing yin” in northern China, while Atractylodis
Rhizoma, Agastache rugosa and other Chinese medicinal
herbs
with
the
property
of
“aromatic
dehumidification” were commonly used in southern
China (Table 6).

According to the report of National
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, up
to February 5th, 2020, 214 COVID-19 patients were
treated with Qing Fei Pai Du Tang in Shanxi, Hebei,
Heilongjiang and Shaanxi Provinces with overall
effective rate ≥ 90%. Among them, the symptoms of
majority of patients (≥60%) were markedly improved,
while illness of others (30%) was stabilized [92]. After
that, 701 COVID-19 patients were treated with Qing
Fei Pai Du Tang in 10 provinces in China. The result
showed that 130 patients (18.5%) were completely
cured after treatment. The treatment also resulted in
the disappearance of characteristic symptoms of
COVID-19 such as fever and cough in 51 patients
(7.27%). In addition, symptom improvement or
stabilization were observed in 268 patients (38.2%),
and in 212 patients (30.2%), respectively [87]. Yao, et
al. and Lu, et al. [93, 94] retrospectively analyzed the
clinical efficacy of Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule in
treatment of confirmed and suspected COVID-19
patients. The results indicated that this herbal product
could markedly relieve major symptoms such as fever
and cough and had the capacity to promote the
recovery.
Some patients with mild illness in the early stage
could suddenly progress to severe disease, and

Applicable regions

Wuhan), South, East, Northwest, and Southwest China.

Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Shanxi,

eventually died due to septic shock with multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which was
associated with cytokine storm [95]. There is
compelling evidence that some TCM herbal products
or its components have potent immunosuppressive
effects, as shown by our own and other’s studies [79,
96-103]. For example, Wang, et al. [104] reported that
Shen Fu Injection could inhibit the lung inflammation
and decrease the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and other
cytokines. Chang, et al. [105] reported that Re Du Ning
Injection could markedly reduce the levels of IL-1β,
TNF-α, IL-8, IL-10, and some other cytokines of
LPS-induced model of acute lung injury in rats. We
recently reported that tetrandrine, a compound
isolated from an anti-rheumatic Chinese herb, could
potently inhibit proinflammatory Th1, Th2 and Th17
responses in LPS-challenged mice [106]. Therefore,
TCM with the capacity to inhibit cytokine storm and
its devastating consequences may be harnessed in the
treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.
Currently, the laboratory study on the effect of
TCM is apparently lagging behind the clinical
application of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19
patients. Nevertheless, some scientists have started to
examine the effect of TCM products or its components
on SARS-CoV-2 in their laboratories. For example, an
http://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
in vitro study showed that Shuang Huang Lian Oral
Liquid had the inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 [78].
However, its clinical efficacy and safety for the
treatment of COVID-19 patients has not been
evaluated. We noticed that this TCM product was not
recommended by HNC’s Guideline [89]. Same as
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor ACE2 for the
cellular entrance [8]. Theoretically, blockade of ACE2
can prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Chen and
Du thus performed the molecular docking study and
they found that TCM-derived compounds, including
as baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin and
nicotianamine could interact with ACE2 [107].
Therefore, these compounds as well as herbs
containing these ingredients may have the capacity to
inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate
more experiment studies showing anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity of TCM or its components will be published
in the near future.

Closing remarks
TCM has accumulated thousand-of-year’s
experiences in the treatment of pandemic and
endemic diseases. Providing complementary and
alternative treatments are still urgently needed for the
management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,
experiences in TCM is certainly worth learning.
Fighting against current epidemics also provide an
opportunity to test the true value of TCM in treating
emerging
contagious
diseases.
Randomized,
double-blind and placebo-controlled studies is the
best way to provide the most reliable evidence for a
therapy, including TCM. It is encouraging that the
controlled clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of
TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV were conducted
and reported. However, the most of these studies
were found to be poorly designed and the results
could lead to potential biases in evaluating the
effectiveness of TCM treatment [13]. Hopefully,
current clinical study to evaluate the effect of TCM on
COVID-19 will use more strict protocols, concealment
of allocation, and double-blinding, in order to ensure
the compliance of international acceptable standards.
Furthermore, standardized products of TCM, rather
than self-prepared formulations, should be used in
clinical study. Experiment study may be able to
elucidate the mechanism underlying the therapeutic
effect of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19. The
further study of TCM may lead to the identification of
novel anti human coronavirus compounds that may
eventually prove to be useful in the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 or other emerging fatal viral diseases as
conventional therapeutic agents.
The safety of TCM in the treatment of emerging
coronavirus diseases was not included in the

1715
observation on SARS patients [13]. It was reported
that some herbs used in TCM contain nephrotoxins
and mutagens [108], while the toxicological features
of the most of Chinese herbal medicines remain to be
fully understood [109]. Furthermore, herbs used in
TCM can mimic, or magnify, or oppose the effect of
conventional medicines [110]. Thus, the safety of TCM
used in treatment of emerging coronavirus infections
should be carefully evaluated. It is particularly
important to avoid toxicity or interfere with the
efficacy of conventional treatment caused by
herb-drug interaction.
