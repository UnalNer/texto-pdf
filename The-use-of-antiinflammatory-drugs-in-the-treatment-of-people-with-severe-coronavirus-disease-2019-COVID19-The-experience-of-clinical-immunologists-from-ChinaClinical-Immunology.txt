Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Cytokine storm
Anti-inflammation treatment

The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. Reports
from China showed that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%. In the past
two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on
the anti-inflammation management of critical COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese
leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients. Here, from the perspective of
clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and
summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID19 that may have an impaired immune system.

Since the sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in Wu Han City, China caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in just two more months, the epidemic has
rapidly spread all over the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Till
March 22, globally, approximately 303,000 confirmed cases, including
more than 12,900 deaths in approximately 150 countries. Data from
China have indicated that about 20% of patients developed severe
disease, older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health
conditions, are at higher risk of death than younger ones. A minority of
patients presented with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction resulting in a fatality of 4%.
In the past two month, we took part in a serial of remote teleconsultation, discussing several critical COVID-19 patients in intensive

care unit (ICU) and clinical pathological conference (CPC). Here, from
the perspective of clinical immunologist and rheumatologists, we would
like to discuss and share our experience in the treatment of severe
COVID-19.
1. Several important features in critical COVID-19 patients
From the point of view of rheumatologists, except for respiratory
failure, the critical COVID-19 patients have common features: 1)
sudden deterioration of disease around one to two weeks after onset; 2)
much lower level of lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in
peripheral blood; 3) extremely high inflammatory parameters, including C reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,
TNFα, IL-8, et al); 4) destroyed immune system revealed by atrophy of

spleen and lymph nodes, along with reduced lymphocytes in lymphoid
organs; 5) the majority of infiltrated immune cells in lung lesion are
monocytes and macrophages, but minimal lymphocytes infiltration; 6)
mimicry of vasculitis, hypercoagulability and multiple organs damage.
Based on the above characteristics of COVID-19, we discuss the
following points in terms of treatment.

markers of systemic inflammation appeared to be extremely elevated.
Therefore, how to block the CS and when to initiate anti-inflammation
therapy is critical for reducing death rate of COVID-19.

2. Inflammatory cytokine storm was very common in patients
with severe COVID-19

Lymphocytopenia is one of the most prominent markers of COVID19, it's also one of the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 in China [12].
Both T cells and NK cells in patients with COVID-19 were reduced. The
degree of reduction was even lower in severe cases the latter had higher
leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) as well. In
some critical ill patients, NK cells were extremely low, or even undetectable. In addition, memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells
were obviously decreased in severe cases [13].
More strikingly, the autopsy findings revealed that the secondary
lymphoid tissues had been destroyed in COVID-19 patients, which is
very unusual from other CS related diseases. Spleen atrophy was observed in all reported cases with decreased numbers of lymphocyte, and
significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, macrophage
proliferation and macrophage phagocytosis were found in spleen.
Similarly, lymph node atrophy and the number of lymph nodes decreased, accompanied by necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining
showed that CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells were decreased in spleen
and lymph nodes [13]. In addition, in the lung with characteristic diffused alveolar damage (DAD), the major infiltrated cells were monocytes and macrophages, moderate multinucleated giant cells, but very
few lymphocytes. Most of the infiltrating lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Importantly, virus inclusion bodies can still be detected in
type II alveolar epithelia and macrophages, despite that the PCR test
was negative in blood or throat swabs [10,12,14]. This finding is consistent with the characteristics of the so called “primary cytokine” storm
induced by viral infection which were mainly produced by alveolar
macrophages, epithelial cells and endothelial cells, rather than those
observed in “secondary cytokine” storm induced by different subsets of
activated T lymphocytes in late stage of viral infection or a complication of T cell-engaging therapies [15,16].
There are two possible reasons for the destruction of the immune
system in patients with COVID-19, lymphocytes directly invaded by
virus or indirectly damaged by CS. As we know that 2019-nCoV infects
target cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while
there was no ACE2 expression on lymphocytes, we speculate that
lymphocytes were probably destroyed by CS.

3. The immune system was impaired in critical COVID-19 patients

Cytokine storm (CS) refers to excessive and uncontrolled release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine storm syndrome can be caused
by a variety of diseases, including infectious diseases, rheumatic diseases and tumor immunotherapy. Clinically, it commonly presents as
systemic inflammation, multiple organ failure, and high inflammatory
parameters.
In infectious diseases, CS usually originates from the focal infected
area, spreading all over the body through circulation. In coronavirus
pneumonia, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), accompanied by rapid virus
replication, a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration and CS led
to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
death [1,2]. Accumulating evidence revealed that a part of severe
COVID-19 patients have a elevated cytokine profile resembling CS in
SARS and MERS. Huang et al. reported the level of inflammatory factors
in patients with COVID-19. They measured cytokine levels in 41 inpatients (including 13 ICU patients and 28 non ICU patients), IL-1B, IL1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFNγ, granulocytecolony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein
(IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), platelet derived growth factor
(PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) were increased, among which IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF,
IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, TNFα were higher in severe patients [3,4]. Notably, there was not pronounce difference of serum IL-6 level been the
ICU and non ICU patients. However, in another retrospective, multicentre cohort study, the same study group reported a significantly
elevation of IL-6 level in non-survival group of patients with COVID-19,
as compared with that of the survivals [5]. Several other reports also
confirmed the elevation of IL-6 in critically ill patients with COVID-19
[6–8].
In severe COVID-19, although patients have lymphcytopenia, the
lymphocytes were activated. One study analyzed the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients, all patients had lymphcytopenia, The
percentage of CD8 + T cell reduction were 28.43% and 61.9% in mild
and severe group respectively, and the NK cell reduction were 34.31%
and 47.62% respectively，in mild and severe groups. Also, serum IL-6
levels in severe group were significantly higher than that in mild group
[9]. In addition, the expression of HLA-DR in CD4 + and CD8 + cells
was increased, CD4 + CCR4 + CCR6 + Th17 cells also increased, and
the cytotoxic particles such as perforin and granolysin were highly
expressed in CD8 + T cells [10].
Consistent with others, most of severe COVID-19 patients in our ICU
ward had persistent very high level of erythematosus sedimentation
rate (ESR), CRP, and high level of IL-6,TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, IL2R, etc., and
were associated with ARDS, hypercoagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), manifested as thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, gangrene of extremities. It is possible that CS exacerbates lung
damage as well as leads to other fetal complications. Siddiqu and Mehra
[11] proposed a 3-stage classification model, recognizing that COVID19 illness exhibited three grades of increasing severity which corresponded with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical
outcome. A small proportion of COVID-19 patients would transit into
the third and most severe stage of illness, which manifested as an extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. In this stage,

4. Mimicry of vasculitis and thrombosis are prominent features in
severe COVID-19 patients
Another prominent clinical manifestation in severe COVID-19 patients is endothelium damage. Mimicry of vasculitis could be seen in
severe COVID-19 patients. Clinically, many critical ill patients have
vasculitis-like manifestations, or even gangrene at their extremities;
Pathology examination revealed the blood vessels of alveolar septum
were congested and edematous, with modest infiltration of monocytes
and lymphocytes within and around blood vessels. Small vessels
showed hyperplasia, vessel wall thickening, lumen stenosis, occlusion
and focal hemorrhage. Hyaline thrombi of micro-vessels were found in
a proportion of severe cases [10,13,14]. Intriguingly, some patients
were tested positive with high titer antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-β2 glycoprotein antibodies,
and were associated with severe thrombosis (unpublished data). The
underlying mechanism of vascular damage may be due to the direct
injury of endothelial cells by virus, leading to DIC, anti-phospholipid
syndrome (APS) and mimicry of vasculitis. The pathological autoimmune responses involved in the anti-virus immunity are worth to be
emphasized.

5. Current knowledge of anti-inflammation treatment in COVID19 patients

(median 5 [3–7]), and methylprednisolone (1–2 mg/kg per day) are
recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible [25].
However, some evidences indicate that the benefit of the use of
glucocorticoids is likely outweighed by adverse effect. Wang et al. reported 44.9% patients of COVID-19 were given glucocorticoid therapy,
with no effective outcomes observed [26]. Russell et al. reported clinical evidence did not support corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19
lung injury [27]. Due to the lack of evidences, the interim guideline of
WHO does not support the use of systemic corticosteroids for the
treatment of viral pneumonia and ARDS for suspected COVID-19 cases
in 22 February 2020 [28]. Therefore, efficacy and associated adverse
effects of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 need further elucidated.

No doubt antiviral and supportive treatments are very important in
the treatment of patients with COVID-19. As CS is relatively common in
severe case and often leads to the exacerbation, anti-inflammation
therapy may help in preventing further injury. As we know, there are a
variety of anti-inflammatory medications, including non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,
immunosuppressants, inflammatory cytokines antagonists (such as IL6R monoclonal antibodies, TNF inhibitors, IL-1 antagonists, janus kinase inhibitor (JAK) inhibitors, et al. Siddiqu and Mehra suggested that
tailored therapy in stage III hinges on the use of immunomodulatory
agents to reduce systemic inflammation before it overwhelmingly results in multi-organ dysfunction. In this phase, use of corticosteroids
may be justified in concert with the use of cytokine inhibitors such as
tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist).
Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a role in modulating
an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the
prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and
prompt recognition and application of such therapy may have the
greatest yield [11,17].
However, there is dilemma of anti-inflammatory therapy, balancing
the risk and benefit ratio is a critical issue. Should we apply anti-inflammation therapy to COVID-19 patients? Which patient should we
treat with anti-inflammation regimen, and when to start? What is the
treatment duration? Which medication is the best choice? All the above
questions are still under intense debate and do not reach a consensus.
The main concern is that anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteroid, may delay the elimination of virus and increase the risk of
secondary infection, especially in those with impaired immune system.
Secondly, biological agents targeting on pro-inflammatory cytokines
can only inhibit specific inflammatory factor, and thus may not be very
effective in curbing the CS in COVID-19 in which other cytokines
maybe of significant importance. Thirdly, some anti-inflammation
medication such as JAK inhibitors also block INF-a production, which is
important in fighting virus, and theoretically may not be suitable for the
treatment of inflammatory CS caused by virus as COVID-19. Finally, the
time window of anti-inflammatory treatment is very important.
According to reports and our observation, severe patients usually underwent abrupt deterioration in 1–2 weeks after onset, and prompt
initiation of the anti-inflammatory therapy at this extremely short time
window is likely to achieve a favorable treatment response.

5.2. Tocilizumab treatment of CS
Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant human IL-6 monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6
receptors (IL-6R), thus blocking IL-6 signaling and its mediated inflammatory response. TCZ has been widely used in rheumatic diseases,
such as rheumatoid arthritis. On August 30, 2017, TCZ was approved in
the United States for severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome
caused by chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) immunotherapy.
Wei Haiming, et al. conducted a retrospective study observing the
efficacy of tocilizumab in treating severe or critical COVID-19 patients
[to be published]. Along with the basic anti-virus treatment, TCZ was
applied to 20 patients 400 mg once intravenously. Within a few days,
the fever returned to normal and other symptoms improved remarkably. 75.0% had improved oxygenation. The opacity lung lesion
on CT scans absorbed in 90.5% patients. In addition, the percentage of
peripheral lymphocytes returned to normal in 52.6% patients. Their
data suggests TCZ might be an effective treatment in severe patients of
COVID-19.
Till now, several clinical trials have been registered on safety and
efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia
in adult inpatients, including a multicenter, randomized controlled trial
for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of novel
coronary pneumonia (NCP) (ChiCTR2000029765), a single arm open
multicenter study on tocilizumab (ChiCTR2000030796), and combination of tocilizumab and other drugs (ChiCTR2000030442 and
ChiCTR2000030894).
5.3. JAK inhibitors

5.1. Glucocorticoids

The receptors of novel coronavirus pneumonia (2019-nCoV), might be
ACE2, which is a cell-surface protein widely existed on cells in the heart,
kidney, blood vessels, especially alveolar epithelial cells. 2019-nCoV could
invade and enter cells through endocytosis. One of the known regulators of
endocytosis is the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). AAK1 inhibitors can interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and can be helpful
in preventing virus infections. Baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor as well as an
AAK1 inhibitor, was suggested a possible candidate for treatment of
COVID-19, considering its relative safety and high affinity. Therapeutic
dosage with either 2 mg or 4 mg once daily was sufficient to reach the
plasma concentration of inhibition [29]. However, as we mentioned
above, the biggest concern about JAK inhibitors is that it can inhibit a
variety of inflammatory cytokines including INF-a, which plays an important role in curbing virus activity. Further clinical trials and detailed
analysis are warranted to confirm their efficacy. To date, there are some
registered clinical trials of JAK inhibitor: “Study for safety and efficacy of
Jakotinib hydrochloride tablets in the treatment severe and acute exacerbation patients of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)”
(ChiCTR2000030170); “Severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)
patients treated with ruxolitinib in combination with mesenchymal stem
cells: a prospective, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial”
(ChiCTR2000029580).

Numerous clinical studies have reported the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of coronavirus pneumonia (such as SARS and
MERS) or influenza pneumonia, but no consensus has been reached.
During the SARS epidemic in 2003, glucocorticoid was the main medication of immunomodulatory therapy. Timely usage of glucocorticoid
could improve the early fever, promote the absorption of pneumonia
and obtain better oxygenation. However, some studies didn't show
beneficial effects with glucocorticoid, or even adverse reactions or delayed virus clearance, leading to deterioration of the disease [18–21].
According to international guidelines for management of sepsis and
septic shock, if glucocorticoid is to be used, small dosage and short-term
application should be applied only for patients in whom adequate fluids
and vasopressor therapy do not restore hemodynamic stability [22].
At present, systemic glucocorticoids administration was empirically
used for severe complications in order to suppress CS manifestations in
patients with COVID-19, such as ARDS, acute heart injuries, acute
kidney complication, and patients with higher D-dimer levels, et al.
[3,23,24] However, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials
to support glucocorticoids treatment for COVID-19. Chen et al. reported
19 (19%) patients were treated with glucocorticoids for 3–15 days

5.4. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine

inflammation therapy. In addition, a timely anti-inflammation treatment initiated at the right window time is of pivotal importance and
should be tailored in individual patient to achieve the most favorable
effects.

Chloroquine (CQ) is an amine acidotropic form of quinine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) differs from chloroquine by the presence of a
hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain: the N-ethyl substituent is βhydroxylated. For decades, CQ and HCQ are front-line medications for
the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and are also used to treat
autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Previous studies reported that CQ/HCQ possess a broad spectrum of
antiviral effects on a variety of viruses as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [30], Marburg virus, Zika virus [31],
dengue virus [32], Ebola virus [33], and SARS-CoV-1 [34,35], etc. CQ
and HCQ can interfere with the binding of viral particles to their cellular cell surface receptor or the pH-dependent endosome-mediated
viral entry of enveloped viruses to inhibit the viral cycle [32]. They can
also interfere with the post-translational modification of viral proteins
or impair the proper maturation of viral protein by pH modulation [36].
In addition, CQ and HCQ can regulate immune system by affecting cell
signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Although CQ or HCQ are frequently used for the treatment of
rheumatic diseases due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, the benefit in treating COVID-19 may be mainly
attributed to its anti-viral effects. Recently, CQ and HCQ have been
shown by several studies to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and
shorten the duration of viremia. Whether their immunomodulatory
effect also plays a role in the treatment of COVID-19 still requires further investigation. For coronaviruses, the potential therapeutic benefits
of CQ were notably reported for SARS-CoV-1. In vitro, CQ can prevent
SARS-CoV-1 from infecting the glycosylation of a virus cell surface receptor, ACE2 [30]. A very recent publication of results showed that CQ
is highly effective in the control of COVID-19 infection in vitro [37].
Till now, 15 clinical trials have been conducted in China to test the
efficacy and safety of CQ or HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19, 8 of
which were CQ, 6 were HCQ, and another included both CQ and HCQ
[38]. So far, in a clinical trial involving more than 100 patients, the
chloroquine phosphate group showed efficacy in reducing the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings and increasing
negative rate of virus nucleic acid test. Given these findings, the
Guidelines (version 6) for treatment of COVID-19 recommends chloroquine phosphate is orally administered at a dose of 500 mg (300 mg
for chloroquine) for adults, 2 times/ day (no more than 10 days) [39].
“Hydroxychloroquine's therapeutic effect on new coronavirus (COVID19)” was registered (NO: ChiCTR2000029559). As of February 17, 20
patients have been enrolled in HCQ & basic treatment group. After
1–2 days of HCQ treatment, clinical symptoms in all patients improved.
After 5 days of HCQ treatment, 19 patients improved on lung imaging
findings. In addition, none of the mild patients had an exacerbation of
disease in HCQ group. Regarding to safety, two of them had adverse
reactions of mild rash and slight headache, and the adverse reactions
disappeared after adjusting the regimen. The results of this clinical trial
confirmed the short-term efficacy of HCQ in the treatment of COVID19, which can effectively improve lung imaging findings, promote a
virus-negative conversion, and shorten the disease course. Although the
number of cases in HCQ group was relatively small, current data can
provide insights for clinicians. The efficacy and safety of HCQ in the
treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and
clinical trials.
In conclusion, COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease mainly manifested as fever and pneumonia, anti-viral and respiratory supportive
therapies are the mainstream of treatments for severe cases. As CS occurs in critical patients, which leads to ARDS and multiple organ damage, and even death, anti-inflammation treatment may be applied.
However, given the viral nature of the COVID-19 CS, and considering a
substantial impairness of host immune system in severe cases, it is
critical to balance the risk and benefit ratio before starting anti-
