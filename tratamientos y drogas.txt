Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment

The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths
were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed
in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More
than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or
repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database.
The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe
the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and
utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with
the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured
trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines,
such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir,
lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less
time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.

The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on
December 31, 2019, about a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan,
Hubei province (China), a city with 11 million inhabitants.
By March 12, 2020, there were 125 048 cases and 4 614 deaths
(nearly 3.7% of cases) reported for the novel coronavirus
(1), named 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and later
renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (2). The WHO named this novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19 (1,2), and there have been confirmed cases in
117 countries or territories outside China, including Japan, the
United States of America, Italy, Iran, and Brazil (1). Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus,
that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals (3,4).
New evidence indicates a link between SARS-CoV-2 and
1

bat coronavirus (3). Six species of coronavirus are known as
infectious in humans, four of which (229E, OC43, NL63, and
HKU1) cause common cold symptoms (4). However, some
authors have claimed that SARS-CoV-2 is even related to the
coronavirus species responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) as well as Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV), which have zoonotic origins linked to
severe significant illness with higher mortality (3,4). For example, in July 2003, the WHO reported 8 437 SARS-CoV cases,
especially in China and Hong Kong, with 813 related deaths
(5). Concerning MERS-CoV, from June 2012 to April 2018, 2 206
people were infected in 27 countries, 1 831 cases in Saudi Arabia, with 787 deaths (6). Unfortunately, there are no vaccines
or medicines approved for the novel coronavirus infection
