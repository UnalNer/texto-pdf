ABSTRACT

The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths
were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed
in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More
than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or
repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database.
The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe
the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and
utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with
the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured
trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines,
such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir,
lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less
time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.

The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on
December 31, 2019, about a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan,
Hubei province (China), a city with 11 million inhabitants.
By March 12, 2020, there were 125 048 cases and 4 614 deaths
(nearly 3.7% of cases) reported for the novel coronavirus
(1), named 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and later
renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (2). The WHO named this novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19 (1,2), and there have been confirmed cases in
117 countries or territories outside China, including Japan, the
United States of America, Italy, Iran, and Brazil (1). Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus,
that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals (3,4).
New evidence indicates a link between SARS-CoV-2 and
1

bat coronavirus (3). Six species of coronavirus are known as
infectious in humans, four of which (229E, OC43, NL63, and
HKU1) cause common cold symptoms (4). However, some
authors have claimed that SARS-CoV-2 is even related to the
coronavirus species responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) as well as Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV), which have zoonotic origins linked to
severe significant illness with higher mortality (3,4). For example, in July 2003, the WHO reported 8 437 SARS-CoV cases,
especially in China and Hong Kong, with 813 related deaths
(5). Concerning MERS-CoV, from June 2012 to April 2018, 2 206
people were infected in 27 countries, 1 831 cases in Saudi Arabia, with 787 deaths (6). Unfortunately, there are no vaccines
or medicines approved for the novel coronavirus infection

Rosa and Santos • Drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment

(7), but more than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test
coronavirus treatments, including some drug repurposing or
repositioning for COVID-19 (8). Drug repositioning for other
neglected diseases is an essential and universal strategy in the
development of new drugs due to: a) lower costs and reduced
time to reach the market because some clinical trial steps might
not be required, especially concerning phases I and II; b) existing pharmaceutical supply chains are available for formulation
and distribution; c) the possibility of combinations with other
drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy;
and d) may facilitate the discovery of new mechanisms of action
for old drugs and new classes of medicines (9,10).
On the other hand, this repurposing strategy has some
limitations, including patent barriers, the complexity of regulatory pathways, absence of funding opportunities, greater
access to data from other industry-sponsored clinical trials,
and the heterogeneity of the population for new clinical studies (10). Nevertheless, drug repurposing is still a tool for the
discovery of entirely new classes of medicines (10,11). Hence,
considering this scenario, we felt that it is of interest to be
aware of the drug repositioning in clinical tests for the COVID2019 treatment.

METHODS
We performed a search on March 12, 2020, at the clinicaltrials.
gov database, with the descriptor [coronavirus] in the simple
search field “conditions or disease” search, without restrictions
on languages, disease conditions, results, or locations. The
eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of
participants and the study period; describe the patient’s clinical
conditions; and interventions utilize medicines already studied
or approved for any other disease in patients with COVID-19.
ClinicalTrials.gov is a resource from the US National Library
of Medicine, and it contains clinical studies conducted by 209
countries.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We identified 24 clinical trials (Table 1), in which 19 studies were at clinical phases 2, 3, or 4. The pharmaceutical
interventions found for COVID-19 treatment include human
immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, oseltamivir, favipiravir, carrimycin,
methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, thalidomide, vitamin C,
pirfenidone, bromhexine, fingolimod, danoprevir, ritonavir,
darunavir, cobicistat, lopinavir, xiyanping, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial
drugs. They have antiviral effects against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), namely by inhibiting virus entry into
host cells. Another antiviral mechanism is related to the
post-­translation alteration of newly synthesized proteins via
glycosylation inhibition (12). Hydroxychloroquine is already
being used in clinical trials on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) treatment (13). In a recent trial with patients
on COVID-19 treatment (14), 100% of patients treated with
hydroxychloroquine in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin were virologically cured comparing with
57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, and

2

12.5% in the control group. Currently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be tested (15,16) in patients with pneumonia
caused by 2019-nCoV and chloroquine as preventative medicine for COVID-19, as shown in Table 1.
Immunoglobulins are useful in several diseases, such as
idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), Guillain-Barre
Syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), Kawasaki disease, and in multiple neurological
autoimmune disorders refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatments (17). Broadly neutralizing antibodies can
recognize a wide variety of glycoproteins (GPs) in virus surfaces or the protein shell of a non-enveloped virus. However,
HIV-1, dengue virus (DENV), influenza viruses, hepatitis C
virus (HCV), and Ebola virus (EBOV) can mutate superficial
GPs in order to evade the antibody response, an obstacle in
the development of new therapies against such infections (18).
Trial NCT04261426 (19) is utilizing human immunoglobulin in
patients with pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (Table 1).
Two clinical studies refer to the use of remdesivir in severe
(20) or mild (21) respiratory infections by SARS-CoV-2.
Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of the EBOV
RNA-polymerase RNA-dependent (RdRp). Dyer et al. 2019 (22)
described preliminary findings of a mortality rate of 33% in 499
patients treated with remdesivir against the EBOV disease in
early infection stages. The same authors noted a mortality rate
of 75% (almost 1 900 people) of non-treated infected patients
during the same epidemic period (22). Wang et al. 2020 (23)
presented data showing that remdesivir is effective against
the 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells (EC90 1.76 μM). The suggested
mechanism for remdesivir involves the host cells' post-entry
stage (23).
Arbidol, also known as umifenovir, is approved in Russia
and China for the treatment of influenza virus infections; it
does not have significant adverse effects and is patented for
SARS treatment (24). As shown in Table 1, four clinical trials
will be conducted for COVID-19 treatment: one with arbidol in
comparison with the basic treatment (25), and the other three
studies comparing effects with oseltamivir (26,27), lopinavirritonavir (27), and carrimycin (28). The arbidol anti-viral
­mechanism against influenza A and B involves viral fusion
inhibition with the targeted membrane, which blocks virus
entry into the cell (24). Oseltamivir is another drug approved
for influenza A and B treatment; it inhibits the viral neuraminidase and, consequently, blocks the release of viral particles
from host cells, reducing the spread in the respiratory tract
(29). Additionally, the use of oseltamivir was already reported
during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, either with or
without antibiotics and corticosteroids (30). Oseltamivir is
also used in a clinical trial with multiple combinations with
chloroquine and favipiravir (31), a nucleoside analog that is
well-known as a broad-­spectrum antiviral drug; it has shown
(23) an EC50 of 61.88 µM against SARS-CoV-2 and low toxicity
(CC50 >400 µM).
The lopinavir-ritonavir combination is approved for AIDS
treatment in several countries. Both drugs are HIV protease
inhibitors, but ritonavir is also a cytochrome P450 and GP
inhibitor, a fact that endorses the lopinavir pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic activities against HIV (32). Such a
combination, plus b-1b interferon, is in phase 2 for the MERS
treatment (33). Several trials involve lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in comparison with the use of other drugs for COVID-19:

Rosa and Santos • Drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment

arbidol (26,27), carrimycin (28), TCM (34,35), xiyanping (36,37),
danoprevir-ritonavir (38) and interferon inhalation (34,38).
Nevertheless, one previous article argued that in a clinical
trial with 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection, the lopinavir-ritonavir combination was not associated with clinical improvement comparing with standard care
procedures (39).
Carrimycin is a macrolide antibiotic with effects against
some gram-positive bacteria and in vitro effects on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (40).
Danoprevir is an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor approved in
China for the treatment of non-cirrhotic genotype 1b chronic
hepatitis C, in combination with ritonavir, peginterferon-a, and
ribavirin (41).
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses phytotherapeutic formulations such as teas, pills, powders or tinctures, and
cultural components that originated 5000 years ago in Chinese medicine (42). TCMs were already used for SARS-CoV
infection in 2002 as coadjuvant therapy with the enhancement of patients' symptoms, increased oxyhemoglobin
arterial saturation; they proved useful in the early stages of
this infection (42).
Interferons (IFNs) are proteins that bind to cellular surfaces’ receptors and initiate JAK-STAT signaling cascades,
with transcriptional regulation of genes controlled by interferons and effects against some viruses like hepatitis B virus and
HCV (43).
Xiyanping is a TCM preparation with andrographolide as a
principal component; it has significant antibacterial and antiviral effects (44).
Darunavir, in combination with cobicistat, will be used in
trial number NCT04252274 (45) in patients with COVID-19
pneumonia. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently approves such a combination in AIDS
treatment. Darunavir is another HIV protease inhibitor, and
cobicistat, like ritonavir, is a booster for enhancing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of darunavir by cytochrome
P450 (CYP3A) inhibition (46,47).
Recombinant human interferon a2b is described to have
inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (48), and the
purpose of the clinical trials found for this paper is to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon a2b in
treating patients with new coronavirus infection (49).
Thalidomide will be used in two trials against COVID-19
(49, 50). Thalidomide has an anti-inflammatory action due to its
ability to speed up the degradation of messenger RNA in blood
cells and thus reduce tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). Furthermore, thalidomide can increase the secretion of interleukins,
such as IL-12, and activate natural killer cells (51).
The corticosteroid methylprednisolone will be tested against
COVID-19 (52). Long et al. 2016 (53) reported that corticosteroid
therapy (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone) is beneficial in treating SARS-CoV patients; it significantly
prolongs the survival time of clinical cases. Nevertheless, other
authors described the use of corticosteroids in the early stages
of SARS infection with increasing values of viral load (54). Furthermore, studies with corticosteroids in the adjuvant therapy
of MERS-CoV infection were unable to prove efficacy because
all patients died (55). Methylprednisolone has already been
used in COVID-19 patients in combination with antibiotics,
oseltamivir, and oxygen therapy (56).

4

Finally, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), pirfenidone, bevacizumab, fingolimod, and bromhexine hydrochloride are going
to be tested on COVID-19 (57-61). Vitamin C has antioxidant
activity and may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation
(57,62), effects that improve vasopressor synthesis, enhance
immune cell function, improve endovascular function, and
provide epigenetic immunologic modifications. Clinical trials
have demonstrated promising data on mortality improvement
in sepsis, but more extensive studies are necessary to validate these conclusions (63). Pirfenidone has been used in the
treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diseases due to
anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, namely by inhibiting IL-1b and IL-4 (58). Trial NCT04282902 claimed (58) that
anti-inflammatory effects may be helpful in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (59,63), and
it may reduce the levels of VEGF caused by hypoxia, severe
inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract
epithelium, all of which might suppress the edema in patients
with COVID-19 (63). Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptor regulator (FTY720) with an effective immunology
modulator that is useful in multiple sclerosis (60). According to
some pathological findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline
membrane formation, the use of immune modulators, together
with ventilator support, should be considered for severe
patients to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study NCT04280588 aims to determine
the efficacy of fingolimod for COVID-19 (60). Bromhexine is
a transmembrane protease serine inhibitor; such a protease is
responsible for the activation of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV for viral entry through the plasma membrane
(61,64). One study (60) will evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine combined with standard treatment/standard treatment in
patients with COVID-19.
In conclusion, the WHO declared an epidemic of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. In this review, we
found 24 clinical trials that have already started with the repositioning of more than 20 medicines for COVID-19 treatment,
such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine,
hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, oseltamivir, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and
TCM. The Hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination
was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical
trials against SARS-CoV-2, but further, more extended studies,
with a higher number of patients, are needed to confirm these
results. Besides its limitations, repositioning clinical trials are
still an attractive strategy: they may facilitate the discovery of
new classes of medicines; they may reduce the costs and time
to reach the market; there is an existing pharmaceutical supply
chain for formulation and distribution; and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are
more effective than monotherapy. Most of the studies found
in this article are scheduled to end in 2020, and we hope these
repositioning trials may help to find solutions for COVID-19
treatment by this year.

Brief communication

Ensayos clínicos de reposicionamiento de medicamentos para el tratamiento
de la COVID-19
RESUMEN

En diciembre de 2019 fue informado a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) un brote de neumonía por
coronavirus en Wuhan, provincia de Hubei, China. Al 12 de marzo de 2020, se habían notificado 125 048 casos
y 4 614 muertes. El coronavirus es un virus ARN envuelto del género Betacoronavirus distribuido en aves,
seres humanos y otros mamíferos. La OMS ha denominado a la nueva enfermedad por coronavirus COVID19. Se han puesto en marcha más de 80 ensayos clínicos para evaluar un tratamiento para el coronavirus,
que incluyen algunos ensayos de reposicionamiento de medicamentos para la COVID-19. En marzo de 2020
se llevó a cabo una búsqueda de los ensayos clínicos registrados en la base de datos clinicaltrials.gov. Los
criterios de elegibilidad para los estudios recuperados fueron tener un número de identificación de la base
de datos clinicaltrials.gov; describir el número de participantes y el período del estudio; describir las condiciones clínicas de los participantes; y emplear intervenciones con medicamentos ya estudiados o aprobados
para cualquier otra enfermedad en pacientes infectados con el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV).
Es esencial destacar que este artículo solo recoge los ensayos que figuran en la base de datos clinicaltrials.
gov. Se identificaron 24 ensayos clínicos relacionados con más de 20 medicamentos, como inmunoglobulina humana, interferones, cloroquina, hidroxicloroquina, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir,
oseltamivir, metilprednisolona, bevacizumab y medicina tradicional china. Aunque el reposicionamiento de
medicamentos tiene algunas limitaciones, el reposicionamiento de los ensayos clínicos puede representar
una estrategia atractiva porque facilita el descubrimiento de nuevas clases de medicamentos; estos tienen
costos más bajos y tardan menos en llegar al mercado; y existen cadenas de suministro farmacéutico que
apoyan la formulación y la distribución.

Palabras clave

Reposicionamiento de medicamentos; ensayos clínicos como asunto; infecciones por coronavirus; virosis;
neumonía viral; pandemias.

Ensaios clínicos de reposicionamento de medicamentos para o tratamento
do COVID-19
RESUMO

A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) foi informada, em dezembro de 2019, sobre um surto de pneumonia por coronavírus em Wuhan, província de Hubei (China). Posteriormente, em 12 de março de 2020, 125
048 casos e 4 614 mortes haviam sido registrados. O coronavírus é um vírus RNA envelopado do gênero
Betacoronavírus, distribuído em aves e em humanos e outros mamíferos. A OMS designou a nova doença
por coronavírus como COVID-19. Mais de 80 ensaios clínicos foram iniciados para testar tratamentos para o
coronavírus, incluindo alguns de reposicionamento de medicamentos para o COVID-19. Assim, em março de
2020 realizou-se uma busca na base de dados clinicaltrials.gov. Os critérios de elegibilidade para os estudos
recuperados foram: conter o número identificador da base de dados clinicaltrials.gov; descrever o número de
participantes e o período do estudo; descrever as condições clínicas dos participantes; e utilizar intervenções
para tratamento de doentes infectados com o novo coronavírus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) com medicamentos
já estudados ou aprovados para qualquer outra doença. É essencial salientar que este artigo apenas capturou ensaios listados na base de dados clinicaltrials.gov. Foram identificados 24 ensaios clínicos envolvendo
mais de 20 medicamentos, tais como imunoglobulina humana, interferons, cloroquina, hidroxicloroquina, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, metilprednisolona, bevacizumabe e medicamentos
chineses tradicionais. Embora o reposicionamento de medicamentos tenha algumas limitações, os ensaios
clínicos de reposicionamento podem representar uma estratégia atraente, porque facilitam a descoberta de
novas classes de medicamentos, têm custos mais baixos, levam menos tempo para chegar ao mercado e se
beneficiam de cadeias de fornecimento farmacêutico já existentes para formulação e distribuição.
