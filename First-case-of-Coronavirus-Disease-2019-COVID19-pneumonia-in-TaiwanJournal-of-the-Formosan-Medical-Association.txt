An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel coronavirus, officially
named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified first in Wuhan, China, and has spread
rapidly in China and to other parts of the world. Herein, we reported the first confirmed case of
novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) imported from China in Taiwan. This case report revealed a
natural course of NCP with self-recovery, which may be a good example in comparison with
medical treatments.

Introduction
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness
later proved to be caused by a novel coronavirus, officially
named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified
first in Wuhan, a city of Hubei province, People’s Republic
of China (PRC). COVID-19 rapidly spreads in China and to
other parts of the world. Currently more than 70,000
laboratory-confirmed cases in China have been reported,
and the case count has been rising daily. Some travelersrelated transmission were also identified in many countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France, United
States (U.S.), Australia, etc. through an international
conveyance, and raised a global health emergency.1 As of
February 18, 2020, there were 22 confirmed cases in
Taiwan. Herein we presented the first case identified in
Taiwan on January 21, 2020.

Case report
On January 20, 2020, a 55-year-old woman who worked in
Wuhan, China, arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport and presented to quarantine officials immediately,
with a history of sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, and lowgrade subjective fever since January 11, 2020. Owing to the
outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and the announcement
of related symptoms, she was immediately placed in
quarantine ward and underwent examination. Although the
patient denied spending time at the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market and reported no known contact with ill
people during her stay in Wuhan, specimens including
oropharyngeal swab and sputum were collected for severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction
(rRT-PCR) in accordance with the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) guidance.
Apart from a history of hypothyroidism with regular
medical follow-up, she had no other underlying disease
before this onset. According to the records of quarantine
officials, the vital sign of the patient showed body temperature (BT) of 38.0  C and oxygen saturation (SPO2) of
88e90% under ambient air. Before seeking medical treatment in Taiwan, she bought over-the-counter medicine to
release the symptoms. After admission to our hospital, her
vital signs remained stable, apart from the exertional dyspnea, intermittent dry cough and sore throat (Fig. 1). The
initial physical examination revealed a BT of 36.4  C, blood
pressure of 93/53 mm Hg, pulse of 87 bpm, respiratory rate
of 20 breath/min, and SPO2 of 91% while the patient was
breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 3 L/min.
The breathing sound was normal initially. The laboratory
results reflected lymphopenia (531 cells/ul), and elevated
aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 78 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 41 U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP, 7.8 mg/
L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 295 U/L) (Fig. 1). A
rapid screening test for influenza A and B showed negative.
The chest X-ray revealed bilateral perihilar infiltration and
ill-defined patchy opacities. On January 21, 2020, the TCDC
confirmed that the patient’s oropharyngeal swab and
sputum tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay.

S.-C. Cheng et al.
The results of serial chest X-rays performed on illness
day 10 (hospital day 1), 13, 17, and 25 coincided with the
changes in SPO2 and revealed slowing remission of worsening patches infiltrating at first (Fig. 2). These radiographic findings and a subsequent chest computed
tomography (CT) indicated the tenacious COVID-19 pneumonia and sequelae (Fig. 3). Antitussive agent, O2 supplement, careful saline infusion and empiric antibiotic with
ceftriaxone (2 gm loading and 2 gm everyday intravenously)
were administered at first. Subsequently, antibiotics were
replaced by oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg every
12 h on illness day 17 for another 1 week. Her urine culture
showed Streptococcus gallolyticus spp pasteurianus, which
was susceptible to above antibiotics. Other cultures showed
non-significance.
On illness day 17, her sputum turned undetectable for
SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay. The results of subsequent
rRT-PCR of oropharyngeal swabs and sputum on illness day
21 and 23, respectively, were repeatedly negative. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued on illness day 27, and
her SPO2 improved to 92%e98% under ambient air. The
patient’s clinical condition improved, apart from intermittent exertional dyspnea. Furthermore, the final results of
rRT-PCR of stool and urine tests, which were not sent for
tests in the beginning, were negative on illness day 25. She
was then discharged on illness day 28 (February 07, 2020).

Discussion
We reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus
pneumonia (NCP) in Taiwan. In accordance with the first
report from China, the major symptoms of COVID-19
infection were mainly cough, fever and dyspnea.2 Our
case presented with mild fever, dyspnea and mild hypoxemia on day 10 of initial illness. At the same time, the chest
X-ray showed bilateral infiltrating pneumonia, which progressed diffusely later. The progression of symptoms in this
case also coincided with the first confirmed COVID-19 case
in the U.S., with fever on day 5 of illness, dyspnea with mild
hypoxemia and radiographical pneumonia on day 9 of
illness.3 Furthermore, reports from China showed all patients had bilateral pneumonia on high resolution CT with
different severity even in mild cases.2,4 These findings
suggested that lower respiratory tract seems to be an
important location for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Our
case turned afebrile since admission (illness day 10), even
without antiviral treatment. Despite pneumonia on chest Xrays worsen in the following seven days, respiratory failure
did not occur eventually. Even though ceftriaxone was
used, the evidence of negative culture and the worsening
chest X-ray findings under antibiotic treatment were not
compatible with the clinical picture of bacterial pneumonia. The effective medical treatment against COVID-19
remains unknown. In spite of the first-reported case in
the U.S. showing promptly-subsided fever after Remdesivir
used on day 12 of illness, with well-improved clinical
symptoms later, the effectiveness of Remdesivir was still
questioned.3 The randomized-controlled trial of treating
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus by the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-beta-1b is
ongoing, more evidence-based data are needed.5

Vital sign, symptoms, and examination by the day of illness and day of hospitalization, January 11 to February 07, 2020.

Figure 2 Chest X-ray showed progression of prominent bilateral perihilar infiltration and ill-defined patchy opacities at bilateral
lungs, which slowly resolved on the follow-up image. (a: January 20; b: Jan. 23; c: Jan. 27; d: February 04).

Some laboratory abnormalities in our case, such as
elevated CRP, LDH, ALT and AST, were also observed in
influenza virus pandemic.6 Lymphopenia has been considered as a poor prognostic factor for severe hospitalized
influenza (H1N1) pandemic 2009,7 as well as severe acute

respiratory syndrome (SARS).8 These findings may explain
common biomarker presentation in viral pneumonia,
including COVID-19. The quarantine period for potentially
COVID-19 infected individuals was challenging by our case’s
laboratory results, her sputum specimens remained positive

Figure 3 Chest CT in convalescent stage showed persistent multifocal GGOs with or without superimposed reticulation and mild
fibrotic change at bilateral lungs, including peripheral subpleural regions of both lower lobes. Two small irregular opacities at the
RUL and RML were probably partially resolved consolidations (arrows).

for SARS-CoV-2 on day 15 and turned negative on day 17 of
illness.
Similar to viral pneumonia due to other etiologies,
ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are the main CT findings of
the patients with COVID-19.9e12 Reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, and consolidation are common
associated findings.9 Crazy-paving pattern was also detected in some cases.10,13 Pure consolidation without GGO is
less common.10 These lesions usually involve bilateral
lungs.9,10 Peripheral distribution of disease was noted in
33% and 85% of patients, respectively.9,10 However, normal
scan at the early stage of COVID-19 can be found in a few
patients when the disease is diagnosed.10
As the NCP progresses, increasing size and density of
these GGOs or crazy paving pattern were reported.9,10,13,15
On the contrary, the GGOs will decrease in size and the
consolidations, if present, will decrease in density when
patients gradually recover.9,15,16 Fibrotic change may be
left as a sequela after recovery as was seen in patients
recovering from SARS.14,15
Our case demonstrated a typical NCP without progression to ARDS. The worst status of her pneumonia was on
illness day 17 (Fig. 2c) and then gradually resolved. Given
the negative rRT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 21 and
23, there were persistent milder bilateral lung opacities on
the chest radiograph on illness day 25 (Fig. 2d) which were
corresponding to bilateral ill-defined GGO patches with or
without reticulation, and mild fibrotic change on CT two
days later (Fig. 3). Chest CT might be a tool to assist
diagnosis accompanying with symptoms and traveling history, because the chest radiograph could be normal in those
patients with mild or no symptoms.3

In summary, our case revealed a natural course of NCP
with self-recovery. Rapid diagnostic assays, effective
treatment and wide use of chest CT will be crucial to
contain the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in the future.
