An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel coronavirus, officially
named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified first in Wuhan, China, and has spread
rapidly in China and to other parts of the world. Herein, we reported the first confirmed case of
novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) imported from China in Taiwan. This case report revealed a
natural course of NCP with self-recovery, which may be a good example in comparison with
medical treatments.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness
later proved to be caused by a novel coronavirus, officially
named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified
first in Wuhan, a city of Hubei province, People’s Republic
of China (PRC). COVID-19 rapidly spreads in China and to
other parts of the world. Currently more than 70,000
laboratory-confirmed cases in China have been reported,
and the case count has been rising daily. Some travelersrelated transmission were also identified in many countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France, United
States (U.S.), Australia, etc. through an international
conveyance, and raised a global health emergency.1 As of
