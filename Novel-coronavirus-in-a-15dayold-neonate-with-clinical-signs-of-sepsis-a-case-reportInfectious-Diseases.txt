ABSTRACT

Introduction: Novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can affect all age groups. The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in
children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this
group can help to make a quick diagnose.
Case report: A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without
cough. His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus. So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay
was done for the neonate and showed to be positive. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care.
Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated. Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition.
Conclusion: When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/
her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus.

Introduction

Case presentation

Coronavirus is one of the most important common
human and animal pathogens [1]. In December 2019,
new coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in China.
It spreaded rapidly in China and worldwide within a
short time [1]. It is now referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It is a highly contagious [2]. The disease is secondary to the coronavirus b family; it has
already led to severe epidemics, including SARS-CoV
(Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Corona Virus) and
MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- Corona
Virus). The mortality rate of SARS-CoV was about 10%
and MERS-CoV was up to 37%. Over the past two decades, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have resulted in more
than 10,000 deaths [3,4]. Some articles have considered
pregnant women as a high-risk group of COVID- 19 [5].
But the latest data in UptoDate suggest that pregnancy
is not an additional risk factor for the infection, and
the risk of disease, treatment and prognosis is similar
to that of nonpregnants [1]. There is currently no information on foetal maternal or vertical transmission [5].
Although the COVID-19 can affect all age groups, the
disease is usually milder in children than in adults, and
may be accompanied by non-specific symptoms, especially in neonates [6]. The presentation of COVID-19 in
children and neonate can range from asymptomatic
infection to severe respiratory distress [6]. The most
common clinical symptoms include fever, fatigue and
dry cough. Some patients have upper respiratory manifestations such as nasal obstruction, nasal discharge
and sore throat, and others have gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea [6]. So far, no mortality has
been reported in children [7]. The diagnosis of COVID19 is based on the contact, travel history and related
laboratory tests [6]. Symptomatic and supportive measures, including oxygen, are the main treatment for
these patients. Intravenous therapy, correction of water,
electrolyte, acid-base imbalances are extremely important as well [6]. Only three newborns have been
reported with COVID-19 [1,6]. These neonates were
36 h, 5 and 17 days old. Their mothers had COVID-19.
The disease is rare in neonates, so its suspicioncan
help for a quick diagnose.
Our aim is to introduce the case. We want to inform
about the likelihood of COVID-19 infection in infants
presenting with non-specific clinical manifestations of
the disease. Especially in the current epidemic, the disease ought to be suspected.

The 15-day-old term neonate was admitted to the neonatal ward of Mousavi Hospital in Zanjan (Iran) due to
fever and lethargy. He was the third child of non-consanguineous parents; he was born by caesarean section
with a birth weight of 3460. His parents recently
reported fever and cough. His mother also had sweating, weakness, and malaise. The infant had no history of
hospitalisation. At admission, he had fever (38.2 axillaries) and mottling. There were no cough, runny nose or
gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination, he was
completely alert, with tachycardia (heart rate of
170 min), tachypnoea (respiratory rate of 66), and mild
subcostal retraction, O2 saturation was 93% (without
oxygen). He was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit (NICU) due to illness and respiratory distress.
There, he was isolated. The supportive and therapeutic
care began. Proper fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, antibiotic therapy by Vancomycin (10 mg/kg/q8h made by
Exir Pharmaceutical Co., Iran) and Amikacin (10 mg/kg/
q8h made by Caspian Tamin Pharmaceutical Co., Iran)
and Oseltamivir (3 mg/kg/12h made by John Lee
Pharmaceutical Co., India) started. Blood tests were
done. Then pharyngeal swab specimens were taken to
evaluate for coronavirus and influenza by ReverseTranscription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay.
Chest X-ray was performed. Consultation with paediatric
cardiologist was requested. According to the Iranian
Ministry of Health guidelines for Novel coronavirus, cases
of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalisation, PCR
testing is not recommended, so no tests were sent to
his parents. The results of the patient’s test were:
WBC ¼ 6700/mL (L: 36%, N: 42%), Hb ¼ 14.4 g/dL,
PLT ¼ 351,000/mL, BS ¼ 59 mg/dL, BUN ¼ 16 mg/dL,
Cr ¼ 0.3 mg/dL, CRP ¼ 1 mg/L, ABG: PH ¼ 7.42, PCo2 ¼
28.5 mmHg, PO2 ¼ 74 mmHg, HCo3 ¼ 22 meq/L, BE ¼
1.5 mmol/L, O2 Sat ¼ 93%.
These results were normal for neonate. Blood glucose
(BS) more than 45 mg/dl is considered normal for this
age. Arterial blood gases (ABG) were also in the normal
range. The chest X-ray was normal. The echocardiography showed the patent foramen ovale (PFO). Blood,
urine and stool culture were negative. RT-PCR for coronavirus was positive and negative for influenza. The
recovery began gradually after the second day of admission. Respiratory distress and mottling resolved. Oral
feeding began and tolerated. Finally, on the sixth day,
he was discharged from hospital in good general condition. He and his parents were quarantined and

monitored for fourteen days. In the follow-up, they
were recovering.

Conclusion

ORCID

The clinical course of COVID-19 in children is milder
than in adults. The most common clinical symptoms
include fever, fatigue, and cough [6]. Only three newborns with the Novel coronavirus were reported, by 1
March 2020 [6]. Case one was 17-day-old with fever,
cough and vomiting [8], the second case was 5-day-old
with fever [6], and the third case was 36-h asymptomatic
[5]. These neonates had a positive history of COVID-19
in their mothers. All three infants had stable vital signs
and no serious complications were reported [6]. An
important finding of our neonate, consistent with the
others, was the presence of fever and a positive history
of COVID-19 in their parents. But our case had no vomiting and cough despite respiratory distress and mottling.
Mottling was not reported in any neonatal case. The
uncomplicated discharge of these neonates, like ours,
indicates a good prognosis of COVID-19 in the neonatal
age group. Therefore, in neonates with non-specific
symptoms of infection, and history of COVID-19 symptoms in their parents, performance of PCR testing for
Novel coronavirus seems reasonable. Especially at this
age, clinical and laboratory symptoms can vary.
