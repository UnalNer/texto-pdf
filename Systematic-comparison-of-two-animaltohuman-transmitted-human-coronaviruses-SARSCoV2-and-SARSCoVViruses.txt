Abstract: After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003,
human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in
respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium
of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak
and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus
causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as “coronavirus disease
2019” (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and
concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in
the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by
these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods,
genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.
Keywords: coronaviruses; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV; genomic comparison; proteomic comparison;

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of viruses that co-infect humans and other vertebrate animals.
CoV infections affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous systems of humans,
livestock, birds, bats, mice, and many other wild animals [1–3]. For example, severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 were both
coronaviruses that transmitted from animals to humans [4,5]. The source of unexplained pneumonia
was first discovered in Wuhan in Dec, 2019, and SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, was isolated from
the respiratory epithelium of patients. It belongs to a new evolutionary branch within the CoV.
On Feb. 11th, 2020, the new coronavirus was officially renamed “SARS-CoV-2” from “2019-nCoV” [6].
The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) [7]. According to

www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses


the data released by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, SARS-CoV-2
was most likely transmitted from wild bats to humans, and all the above three CoVs can transmit from
person to person [8–10]. SARS-CoV-2 shares a highly similar gene sequence and behavior pattern with
SARS-CoV [11]. This paper summarized the similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV, both of which cause major disease outbreaks in China and worldwide, which will provide
comprehensive reference for epidemic prevention.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Collection
The complete genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from 2019 Novel Coronavirus
Resource (2019nCoVR) [12] and two databases, including the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) [13] and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [14]. The DNA
sequences of two other representative CoVs (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) were included for comparative
analysis. The genomic information of latest SARS-CoV-2 strains is shown in Table S1.
2.2. Homology Analysis
The amino acid sequences of 28 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 were compared with those of SARS-CoV
to analyze protein homology by using NCBI Blastp [15]. Proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 were
treated as homologous: identity value ≥ 65%, query coverage ≥ 95%.
2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis
Comparative genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were performed by zpicture for
the global comparison [16]. Multiple sequence alignment and the construction of phylogenetic trees of
38 CoVs were conducted using MEGA7 [17]. The evolutionary distances were calculated using the
Maximum Composite Likelihood method [18].
3. Results
The differences and similarities of clinical characteristics between COVID-19 and SARS were
summarized in Table 1.

3.7. Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment
3.7.1. Prevention
As the number of COVID-19 patients in China has been growing rapidly, preventing the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 is the most important and urgent task [57]. It was shown that human-to-human
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has spread via droplets or close contacts [58,59], but aerosol and fecal-oral
transmission still need further study [60,61]. To reduce virus transmission, early detection and isolation
are essential. In addition, close monitoring in crowded places is also important [62]. The possible
pathogens of SARS and COVID-19 are both derived from wild animals [63]. Therefore, hunting,
selling, and eating wild animals not only seriously damage the ecosystem, but also lead to the spread
of epidemic diseases [64]. Thus, banning all wildlife trade is an effective measure to prevent viral
prevalence. Wearing level-D protective clothing can protect medical staff from infection of respiratory
viruses [65]. A vaccine against SARS-CoV has not been described in any published articles [66].
However, on Jan. 26th, 2020, the China CDC started to develop a new vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.
The virus has been successfully isolated and seed strains have been screened [67].
3.7.2. Diagnosis
The early symptoms of SARS and COVID-19 are very similar to winter influenza, and the
most important way to distinguish flu and pneumonia is to take throat swabs for viral testing [68].

Viruses 2020, 12, 244

Current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR
(rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, as well as real-time
RT-LAMP [69–72]. National Medical Products Administration has approved seven new nucleic acid
test reagents for coronavirus, which were developed based on fluorescence PCR by Feb. 1st, 2020 [73].
Suspected infections can be detected accurately and quickly for timely isolation and treatment to avoid
infecting others by using these test reagents.
3.7.3. Treatment
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are CoVs; hence, the treatment strategies of SARS could be
relevant for COVID-19 [74]. In 2003, SARS was mainly treated by isolation of the patients, hormones
treatment, antiviral and symptomatic treatments, and many drugs such as glucocorticoid [29] and
interferon [75]. Now, isolation, antiviral, and symptomatic treatments are still mainly adopted for
COVID-19 treatment. As effective drugs for SARS, hormones and interferons can also be used to treat
COVID-19 [74]. Lopinavir is one kind of protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection, with ritonavir
as a booster. Lopinavir and/or ritonavir has anti coronavirus activity in vitro. Hong Kong scholars
found that, compared with ribavirin alone, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin
had lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death caused by SARS-CoV [76,77].
Lopinavir/ritonavir has also been clinically tested in treatment of COVID-19, and showed wonderfully
effective treatment for some patients, but the general clinical effect has not been determined [78].
More effective treatments are still under continuing exploration: On Jan. 25th, 2020, a joint research
team from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shanghai
Tech University screened and identified 30 potential drugs that are reported to be effective against
SARS-CoV-2 [79]. A high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro)
was announced after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world [80], and human coronaviruses (HCoVs)
have been treated as severe pathogens in respiratory tract infections. Nelfinavir was predicted to be a
potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease [81]. The first patient in the US had been trial-treated
with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development) due to a severe
infection [82,83]. No adverse reactions were observed during the administration, and the patient’s
condition was effectively improved [84]. Clinical trials of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 just
started on Feb. 5th and 12th, 2020 in Wuhan and Beijing, respectively, and the experimental results
remain unclear [85,86].
3.8. Genomic Comparison
CoVs are RNA viruses and contain the largest genomes of all RNA viruses [87]. CoVs belong
to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, and this
subfamily includes four genera: α-coronavirus, β-coronavirus, γ-coronavirus, and δ-coronavirus [88].
Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are in the coronavirus family, β-coronavirus genera [89]. The genome
of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 85% similar to the genome of the SARS-like virus ZC45 (bat-SL-CoVZC45,
MG772933.1), and together these types of viruses form a unique Orthocoronavirinae subfamily
with another SARS-like virus ZXC21 in the sarbecovirus subgenus [35]. All the three viruses show
typical β-coronavirus gene structure. Human SARS-CoV and a genetically similar bat coronavirus
(bat-SL-CoVZXC21, MG772934) from southwest of China have formed another clade within the
sarbecovirus [35].
We also performed comparative genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by zpicture.
The results showed that the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have extremely high
homology at the nucleotide level (Figure 4a,b). There are six regions of difference (RD) in the genome
sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the RDs are named according to the order of
discovery. RD1, RD2, and RD3 (448nt, 55nt, and 278nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of
the orf lab gene; RD4 and RD5 (315nt and 80nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of the S gene;
RD6 is 214nt in size and is part of the coding sequence of the orf7b and orf8 genes. These RDs may

genes. These RDs may provide new molecular markers for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV, and also help to develop new drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

To analyze the homogeneity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary tree
was constructed based on the genomes of 35 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different data submission
units, one SARS-CoV strain, and two MERS-CoV strains (Figure S1). Phylogenetic analysis showed
that the distance of SARS-CoV (AY274119) is closer to SARS-CoV-2 strains than MERS-CoV
(KC164505, JX869059).
3.9. Proteomic Comparison
To further explore whether all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to that of
SARS-CoV, we performed a protein sequence alignment analysis using Blastp. The results showed that
most of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are highly homologous (95%–100%) to the proteins of SARS-CoV virus,
indicating the evolutionary similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). However, two
proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2 have no homologous proteins in SARS-CoV. The amino acid
sequence of orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 is different from sequences of conserved orf8 or orf8b derived from
human SARS-CoV [11]. Orf8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 does not contain known functional domain or
motif. An aggregation motif VLVVL (amino acid 75–79) has been found in SARS-CoV orf8b which
was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activate NOD-like receptor family pyrin
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes [90]. Therefore, it will be clinically meaningful to
analyze the biological function of these two specific proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2.

As the most abundant protein in CoVs, nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly conserved across
CoVs [91]. The N protein in SARS-CoV-2 shares ~90% amino acid identity with that in SARS-CoV [28],
which indicates that antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV would likely recognize and bind the N
protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well. N antibodies do not provide immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the
antibodies have a cross reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein viruses, which would allow a serum-based
assay to identify the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected-cases [28]. Although previous studies have
found serum reactivity to group SARS-CoV N proteins in Chinese populations [92], exposure to
SARS-CoV-2 should increase the dilution factor if the infection had occurred. This information has
important implications for preventing the spread of asymptomatic infections.
In addition, spike stalk S2 in SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those
of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45) and human SARS-CoV [11].
Thus, the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 has the potential to be effective treatment [93].
3.10. Pathogenic Mechanisms
Many studies have been performed to study the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV [94–96]. The spike (S)
protein and N protein confer stability to the viral particle [97]. The N protein is a structural protein
involved in virion assembly, and plays a pivotal role in virus transcription and assembly efficiency [97].
S protein can bind to the cellular receptors of sensitive cells and mediate infection of their target
cells, after which it begins to replicate in the cytoplasm [98]. SARS-CoV mainly targets the lungs,
immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels and causes systemic vasculitis and decrease of
immune function [99]. More seriously, the infection leads to extensive pulmonary consolidation, diffuse
alveolar damage, and the formation of a transparent membrane, finally deteriorating to respiratory
distress [100].
CoV can enter host cells through the interaction between CoV S protein and its host receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is isolated from SARS-CoV–permissive Vero-E6 cells.
The receptor-binding motif (RBM) of S protein can directly contact ACE2 [47,101,102]. AEC2 have
been identified to be key binding residues and functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and it can also
protect alveolar cells [103]. The binding of spike protein to ACE2 and the subsequent downregulation
of this receptor contribute to severe alveolar injury during SARS [49]. The downregulation of
ACE2 results in the excessive production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE, and the
stimulation of type 1A angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1A) can lead to the increase of pulmonary vascular
permeability, which potentially explains the increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is
decreased [104]. ACE2-transfected T cells form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein.
The virus was shown to replicate effectively in ACE2-transfected, but not in mock-transfected T cells.
Antibodies targeting ACE2 can block viral replication in Vero-E6 cells [105].
Recently, Ji et al. demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of
binding ACE2 in the context of the SARS-CoV spike protein [51]. Among SRAS-CoV spike protein’s
fourteen residues predicted to interact directly with human ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV, eight
amino acids are well conserved in homology SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [26,102]. At the same time,
Wan et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to infect humans, bats, civets, monkeys,
and swine, but not mice [106]. Compared to previously reported SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV-2 uses
ACE2 receptors more efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2003), but less efficiently than human
SARS-CoV (year 2002) [106]. The mutation of proteins determines two important characteristics of the
SARS-CoV-2: A higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat-like SARS-CoV, but a
lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV [43].
4. Discussion
As a large number of people have left Wuhan, the control of the epidemic situation is extremely
urgent, and the treatments of COVID-19 are imminent. On Feb. 14th, 2020, there were more than
54,000 confirmed patients in Hubei province, China [55]. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs,

Viruses 2020, 12, 244

the prognosis of patients solely depends on their age and physical condition [74]. Although it was
reported that the clinically recovered patients exceed the number of dead, the majority of the patients
are still not cured in hospital. In addition, the potential adaptive mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes it
difficult for vaccine development. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop more sensitive inspection
methods and effective drugs.
Seven type of CoVs have been identified to cause human disease [107]. The two highly pathogenic
viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans. The other four
human CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) induce only mild upper respiratory
diseases, although some of them can cause severe infections in infants, young children, and elderly
individuals [4,108]. The latest one is SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shared almost
80% of the genome with SARS-CoV [11]. Our results also showed that almost all encoded proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins (Table 2). Hence, clinical drugs and therapies for
treating SARS may be used as a reference for COVID-19 treatment [74].
In addition to the well-known SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as one Merbecovirus subgenus of β-CoVs,
is also extremely invasive. MERS-CoV is the pathogen of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,
which can infect both humans and animals, and can be transmitted through camels [109]. It mainly
occurs in Saudi Arabia and has a high mortality rate [66]. Studies had demonstrated that the clinical
course of SARS and MERS was highly similar, and SARS and MERS may have similar pathogenesis [66].
The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV. It will be
very interesting to study the relationship among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 that may be
exploited for future developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.
Although more and more studies for SARS-CoV-2 have sprung up since the outbreak of this
epidemic COVID-19, based on our comparison, we propose some key questions to be clarified in future
studies (Table 3). In-depth understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will
reveal more targets for better therapy of COVID-19.
Table 3. Proposed questions to study SARS-CoV-2 for future studies.
What is the effect of the surface epitope and receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the virus’ infectivity?
Is there any effect of SARS-CoV vaccine designed according to S protein on SARS-CoV-2?
Does SARS-CoV-2 orf8 and orf10 proteins, which have no homology proteins in SARS-CoV, play roles in the infectivity
and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?
Can the susceptibility of asymptomatic carriers be judged by detecting the serum reactivity level of N protein?
Apart from droplet transmission and contact transmission, are there other methods to transmit SARS-CoV-2?
What is the percentage of COVID-19 patients have been infected with SARS and produced antibodies?
Is there an effective specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 solution?
Does traditional Chinese medicine have any effect on the treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2?
Do ethnic differences affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?
Do any environmental factors, such as regional conditions or climate, affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission?
