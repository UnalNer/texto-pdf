Abstract
The MIRACLE trial (MERS-CoV Infection tReated with A Combination of Lopinavir/ritonavir and intErferon-β1b)
investigates the efficacy of a combination therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir and recombinant interferon-β1b provided
with standard supportive care, compared to placebo provided with standard supportive care, in hospitalized
patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS. The MIRACLE trial is designed as a recursive, two-stage, group sequential,
multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial. The aim of this article is to describe the
statistical analysis plan for the MIRACLE trial. The primary outcome is 90-day mortality. The primary analysis will
follow the intention-to-treat principle. The MIRACLE trial is the first randomized controlled trial for MERS treatment.

Background
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by the Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS cases continue to occur and are often associated with respiratory
and multiorgan failure [1]. There is no antiviral treatment with proven efficacy at present [1, 2].
The MIRACLE trial (MERS-CoV Infection tReated
with A Combination of Lopinavir/ritonavir and intErferon-β1b) is the first randomized controlled trial for
MERS treatment. The study protocol has been previously published [3].
There are several challenges in a trial for treatment of a
disease like MERS: (1) there is not enough information on
the effect size of the lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b
provided with standard supportive care compared to placebo provided with standard supportive care to conduct
adequate planning for the study sample size; (2) MERS is
a sporadic, unpredictable, and rare disease, which makes it
difficult to plan a separate pilot study to collect the necessary information needed for the planning of the main trial.
To overcome these challenges, we designed the MIRACLE
trial as a recursive two-stage adaptive trial, which is a relatively new method for group sequential trials [4–7]. The
approach is based on the conditional error principle,
which allows for flexible and continuous adjustment of
the trial parameters using data observed during prior
stages without inflation of the type I error [8]. Another advantage of this method is the flexibility in setting the timing and the number of needed interim analyses. Such
flexibility is necessary in a situation where recruitment
rate is unpredictable and a sudden flux in recruitment of
patients could happen at any time. Finally, the design
takes advantage of the accumulated information throughout the trial from every single recruited patient as opposed
to a traditional two-study approach (pilot followed by the
main trial).
In this article, we describe the MIRACLE trial statistical analysis plan (SAP) in advance of trial completion.
We identify the procedures to be followed for the primary and secondary analyses for the trial. The SAP was
written by the study steering committee members led by
the principal investigator, who remains blinded to both
group allocation and to study results until after completing patient recruitment, patient follow-up, and completion and locking of the database. The final study report
will follow the guidelines of the Consolidated Standards
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for reporting randomized controlled trials [9, 10].
The trial is being conducted according to the standard
requirements of Good Clinical Practice E6 [11]. The
SAP was developed in accordance with the International
Council for Harmonisation guidelines (E9 Statistical
principles for clinical trials and E3 clinical study reports

Page 2 of 8

guidelines) [12, 13] and with the Guidelines for the Content of Statistical Analysis Plans in Clinical Trials [14].

Methods
Study design

The MIRACLE trial is a recursive, two-stage, group sequential, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind trial. The trial includes hospitalized patients who are 18 years old or older with laboratoryconfirmed MERS in addition to evidence of acute organ
dysfunction that is judged related to MERS. Inclusion
and exclusion criteria have been detailed in a previously
published protocol manuscript [3]. Patients are randomized to receive lopinavir/ritonavir and recombinant
interferon-β1b or placebo. Randomization is stratified
according to center and according to whether the patients require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) at the time of enrollment, as mechanical ventilation is a major, but pragmatic, surrogate for severity of
illness. The study interventions continue for 14 days or
until hospital discharge. Patients are followed up daily
until day 28 or hospital discharge and then at day 90.
Study population

A CONSORT flow diagram of the trial progress will be
constructed (Fig. 1). The number of randomized patients
to each group will be reported as well as the number of
randomized patients who received the interventions. We
will also report the number of screened patients (defined
as all hospitalized patients with MERS) who met the eligibility criteria but were not enrolled and the reasons for
non-enrollment.
The intention-to-treat population consists of all enrolled patients whether or not they received the allocated intervention, and will be used for the primary
analysis. A per-protocol analysis will be conducted for
patients who received the allocated interventions (defined by any dose of the study intervention).
Data

Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics will be presented for the two
study groups (Additional file 1: Table S1) including age,
sex, and body mass index, the presence of co-infections,
nosocomial versus community-acquired MERS infection,
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
scores, and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score
[3]. We will report comorbidities and the interventions received before randomization for the patients in each
group. We will report baseline laboratory values (international normalization ratio, platelet count, hemoglobin,
white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, liver enzymes,
glucose, serum amylase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,

presented in Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S4,
and S5).

In addition, we will compare the physiological parameters among patients treated in the treatment group and
the control group.

outcome that accounts for the recursive design, as described in Chang [4].
Data and Safety Monitoring Board and interim analyses

A detailed interim analysis plan is reported in the MIRACLE protocol [3]. The trial is designed as a recursive,
two-stage, group sequential randomized trial. The first
interim analysis will be conducted when 34 subjects (17
per group) have completed 90 days of follow-up. This is
about 17.5% of the total sample size needed for the classical design (a classic two-group design requires a total
of 194 subjects (97 subjects per group) to have an 80%
power at a significance level of 5% using a one-sided Z
test for difference in proportion to detect 20% absolute
risk reduction in 90 days mortality among subjects receiving treatment (20%) compared to a control group
(40%)). A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
will be convened to review the unblinded data (efficacy
and safety) and advise on continuation or termination of
the trial. The determination of the stopping boundaries
in the first two-stage design was calculated using the
conditional power method based on the summing stagewise p values. At the first interim analysis, the DSMB
will determine whether the trial should be terminated
for futility or not using the following boundaries and
their corresponding decisions (Table 2).
Demographics and clinical characteristics

We will summarize and report the demographics and
baseline clinical characteristics using descriptive statistics. As appropriate, the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact
test will be used to compare the categorical variables,
which will be reported as numbers and percentages. Student’s t test or the Mann–Whitney U test will be used as
appropriate to compare the continuous variables, which
will be reported as means and standard deviations or as
medians and interquartile ranges.
Analysis of adverse events

All adverse events will be grouped using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version
4 of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Additional
file 1: Table S6). Adverse events will be grouped into aggregate groups and reported for the entire study period
(Additional file 1: Table S7). All results will be

summarized in terms of frequency and percentage and
will be compared across study arms using Fisher’s exact
test. All results will be declared statistically significant
with a p value < 0.05.
Analysis of the primary outcome and continuous planning
of the trial

Let K be the number of stages of the current clinical trial
needed to complete the trial and i ∈ {1, 2} be the index
for the two-stage design in the kth stage. Let r1ki and r2ki
be the proportions of 90 days mortality in the standard
of care and treatment group respectively. Then the Z
test statistic for the difference in proportion can be calculated as follows:

δ ki ¼ r 1ki− r 2ki ;
where nki is the sample size per group for the ith twostage design of the kth stage. In the interim analysis (i.e.,
at each i = 1 of the kth two-stage), the primary outcome
will be evaluated, and the trial sample size will be reestimated for the subsequent stage based on the observed effect size using the following formula assuming a
conditional power of 80% (Pc = 0.8) to decide if the trial
should continue:

Here αk, 2 is the precalculated rejection boundary for
efficacy at the second stage of the two-stage design at
the kth stage, and pk, 1 is the raw table probability corresponding to the Zki statistic. At the first interim analysis,
should the data suggest that another stage of the twostage steps is required, we will recalculate the conditional error and new boundaries will be calculated for
K = 2. Let βk + 1, 1, αk + 1, 1 be the rejection boundaries
for futility and efficacy for the first (i = 1) of the twostage step of the kth + 1 stage. Then the conditional error
is:

α1 is the maximum probability threshold under which the trial will be terminated early for efficacy. β1 is the maximum probability threshold above which the trial
will be terminated for futility. α2 is the maximum probability threshold (the sum of the stage-wise p-values), above which the study will be declared as met its
endpoint

where nk0, 1 and nk0, 2 are the sample sizes for the first
and second stage of the last kth two-stage design, and
pk0, 1, pk0, 2 are the stage-wise adjusted p values.
In order to stay consistent with the method that was
used in calculating the boundaries for the trial, we will
not account for stratification in the primary outcome
analysis. In general, this approach is acceptable and it
preserves both type I and type II errors as long as the
weighted average of the effect size stays close to the hypothesized effect size [15]. Furthermore, as long as the
sample size re-estimation at the interim analysis was
based on the weighted average of the effect size, the
overall power of the trial will be preserved.
Secondary analyses of the primary outcome, secondary
outcomes, and subgroups

With the exception of the analysis of the primary outcome, all other analyses will be tested using regular

Page 6 of 8

statistical methods and will be two-sided. A secondary adjusted analysis will be conducted using multiple logistic
regression analysis, in which death within 90 days will be
modeled as the dependent variable, and a set of baseline
variables that are strongly believed to affect the outcome
of MERS will be included as independent variables. Those
variables will include at minimum the following: age,
community-acquired versus hospital-acquired infection,
mechanical ventilation, center, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ninety-day median survival time
will be summarized and reported using Kaplan–Meier
curves and will be compared between the study groups
using the log-rank test (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Analysis of secondary outcomes will be compared in the
intention-to-treat cohort only. Subgroup analyses will be
conducted if patient numbers permit (e.g., no fewer than
five patients in subgroups of interest) in a priori defined
subgroups (Additional file 1: Table S5). Multivariable logistic regression will be used to report the results of tests
of interactions for these subgroups.
Handling of missing data

All missing data will be reviewed and characterized in
terms of their pattern (e.g., missing completely at random, missing at random, etc.). For missing completely at
random, all analyses will be based on a list-wise deletion
approach where only observations with complete values
will be considered for analysis. For variables with values
missing at random, multiple imputation techniques will
be utilized to impute the missing values, as suggested by
Rubin [16].
Adjustment multiplicity testing for the secondary analyses

To adjust for multiple testing, we will use the false discovery rate (FDR) as described by Benjamini and Hochberg [17]. In this procedure all hypothesis tests will be
sorted in ascending order based on their calculated p
value. All hypothesis tests below an index K will be
rejected, where K is calculated as follows:
K ¼ max i : pðiÞ ≤

i
:q ;
m

where i = m, … ,1, m is the total number of tested hypotheses, and q = 0.05.

Discussion

care, in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed
MERS.
The first patient was enrolled in November 2016. At
present, 14 sites are actively screening for eligible patients. The recruitment rate in the MIRACLE trial has
been slow mainly related to the decline in the number of
MERS cases in Saudi Arabia. Due to the uncertainty of
the efficacy level of the treatment and the recruitment
rate, the trial is designed to be a recursive, two-stage,
group sequential randomized trial [4].
Several methods could be utilized to build an adaptive
trial. However, most of these methods would require
one to specify a priori the time and type of adjustments
that need to take place in the trial. For a disease such as
MERS there are many factors that could limit the ability
to specify a priori those elements; thus, the recursive
two-stage design is a natural choice. This type of design
provides enough flexibility to introduce different adjustments while learning from the observed data without inflating the type I error.
Reporting of the SAP to the MIRACLE trial in advance
of trial completion will enhance evaluation of the clinical
data and support confidence in the final results and the
conclusion. Prior specification of the statistical methods
and outcomes analysis will facilitate unbiased analyses of
these important clinical data.

Trial status

Recruitment started in November 2016 and is currently
ongoing.
