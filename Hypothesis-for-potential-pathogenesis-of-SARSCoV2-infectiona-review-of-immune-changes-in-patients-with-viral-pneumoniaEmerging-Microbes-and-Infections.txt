Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the main means of transmission. Since the ﬁrst case appeared in Wuhan, China,
in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now, according to oﬃcial data released by the
Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually
being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients
developed severe and die from multiple organ complications. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans
remains unclear. Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no speciﬁc
antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and
other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of
COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and
low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been on the top news again
after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [1] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERS-CoV) outbreak in Saudi Arabia
and south korea [2], since a new Coronavirus occurred
in Wuhan, Hubei province and quickly spread across
over whole China and other 30 countries. Up to date
(25 February 2020), there are approximately 80000
infectious patients conﬁrmed and caused above 2500
death [3], which need urgent viral infection identiﬁcation and intervention as early as possible. Although
nucleic acid testing played an utmost part in the detection of the viral genome sequence [4], over-hypersensitivity and dependence on sampling may lead to some
degree of false-positive or false-negative in the clinic.
Despite several types of research have been conducted
to practical treatments or any possible medicines, the
consensus has not recommended any antiviral medicine [5]. It has been conﬁrmed that the immune system
played a vital role in defense against SARS-CoV and
MERS infection. Immune changes in patients with
SARS [6], MERS [7] and inﬂuenza [8], especially
changes in peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets,
contribute to understanding the characteristics,
diagnosis, monitoring, prevention and treatment of
the disease.
