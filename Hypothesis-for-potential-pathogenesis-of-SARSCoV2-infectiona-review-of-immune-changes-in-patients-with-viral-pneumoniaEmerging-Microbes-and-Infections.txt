ABSTRACT

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the main means of transmission. Since the ﬁrst case appeared in Wuhan, China,
in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now, according to oﬃcial data released by the
Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually
being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients
developed severe and die from multiple organ complications. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans
remains unclear. Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no speciﬁc
antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and
other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of
COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and
low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.

KEYWORDS COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anticoagulation; IVIg; pathogenesis

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been on the top news again
after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [1] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERS-CoV) outbreak in Saudi Arabia
and south korea [2], since a new Coronavirus occurred
in Wuhan, Hubei province and quickly spread across
over whole China and other 30 countries. Up to date
(25 February 2020), there are approximately 80000
infectious patients conﬁrmed and caused above 2500
death [3], which need urgent viral infection identiﬁcation and intervention as early as possible. Although
nucleic acid testing played an utmost part in the detection of the viral genome sequence [4], over-hypersensitivity and dependence on sampling may lead to some
degree of false-positive or false-negative in the clinic.
Despite several types of research have been conducted
to practical treatments or any possible medicines, the
consensus has not recommended any antiviral medicine [5]. It has been conﬁrmed that the immune system
played a vital role in defense against SARS-CoV and
MERS infection. Immune changes in patients with
SARS [6], MERS [7] and inﬂuenza [8], especially
changes in peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets,
contribute to understanding the characteristics,

diagnosis, monitoring, prevention and treatment of
the disease.

Immune changes in SARS
In the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection, rapid
reduction of lymphocytes in peripheral blood [6],
mainly T lymphocytes, was observed, and both CD4+
and CD8+ T lymphocytes were decreased. The loss of
lymphocytes precedes even the abnormal changes on
the chest X-ray [9,10]. After a one-year follow-up of
SARS patients, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells recovered rapidly during the disease recovery period. CD8+
T lymphocytes, which returned to normal within 2–3
months after onset. The memory CD4+ T cells
returned to normal a year after onset, whereas other
cell counts including total T lymphocytes, CD3+
cells, CD4+ cells, and naive CD4+ T cells were still
lower than healthy controls [11]. It assumed that
after a viral infection, lymphocytopenia in peripheral
blood due to lymphocyte sequestration ﬁrstly. The
increase in lymphocytes during recovery is not new
cells produced by the thymus, but lymphocyte recirculation between peripheral blood and tissues or organs

[11]. SARS-speciﬁc IgG antibodies are produced in the
late acute stage about 2 weeks and gradually increase
with the course of the disease [12]. The sustainable
existence of IgG makes the patients acquire the
immune function after infection. Recovering patients
have high and sustained levels of S protein-speciﬁc
neutralizing antibody responses, which may play an
important role in determining disease outcome [13].
The IgG level of mild patients was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of severe patients. In the course of disease
progression, patients may be accompanied by
increased IL-8 and TNF-α levels, which peak in the
early stage of recovery, while MCP-1 shows a rapid
increase in the early acute stage and gradually decreases
with the progress of the disease. Based on the above
ﬁndings, it is proposed to treat the disease with a
low-dose of glucocorticoid for less than 2 weeks in
the early stage of the disease, so that the symptoms of
most severe patients are well controlled [9]. This is
diﬀerent from the eﬀect of high-dose of glucocorticoids
described in other literature [14].

Immune changes in MERS
A previously unknown coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
which isolated from a patient in 2012 [15] and caused
high mortality rates in family-based and hospital-based
outbreaks [2], was similar to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The genomic
structures of the two viruses are very similar, both
single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, but when
they enter host cells, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV
attach to diﬀerent receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DDP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) respectively [16,17]. Besides, the clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection, like SARS-CoV,
range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic
shock, and multi-organ failure resulting in death
[15]. Though the clinical pathogenesis have not been
explained clearly, a retrospective study [7] comparing
45 patients in South Korea has suggested that a
decreasing number of peripheral lymphocyte (lymphopenia as an absolute lymphocyte count lower than
1,000 cells/mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count
lower than 150000 cells/mm3) and high CRP level
could predict pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure at the early course of
the disease. This result is supported by evidence of
the report by Min et al. [18]. Whereas it should be
noteworthy that lymphopenia in MERS infection is
not signiﬁcant as SARS patients [19], and research
found that except immunosuppression state and concomitant infection, age was the only predictor [20].
Concerning MERS-CoV T cell responses, within
two weeks after the onset of symptoms (acute
phase), besides pro-inﬂammatory cytokine/chemokine

secretion, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-X-C motif
chemokine (CXCL)-8 [21,22], high frequencies of
MERS-CoV-reactive CD8+ T cells were observed in
patients with severe/moderate illness, which before
the detection of humoral and CD4+ T cell responses.
During the convalescent phase, the magnitude of the
CD8+ T cell response was not greatly augmented
[22]. This result indicates that the ineﬃcient control
of invading MERS-CoV brings about robust inﬂammatory and CTL responses, which play a vital role
in clearing the virus. Further, PBMCs obtained on
day 24 after illness onset shows a strong speciﬁc Tcell response against the MERS-CoV S protein [23].
Role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) protection
from MHV(a member of the same beta coronavirus
group as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) virus clearance
also been demonstrated in animal experimental
models [24].
Zhao, J et al. [25] found that during the convalescent
phase, neutralizing (PRNT50) antibody titers
measured in vitro predicted serum protective ability
in infected mice and correlated with CD4 but not
CD8+ T cell responses. And in their experiment, the
CD4+ T cells were phenotypically eﬀector memory
(CD45RA−CCR7−) cells, while the virus-speciﬁc
CD8+ T cell populations were half eﬀector
(CD45RA-CCR7−) cells and half CD45RA+CCR7−
cells. Persistent and gradual increases of lymphocyte
responses after symptom onset in MERS patients
may be required for eﬀective immune responses against
MERS-CoV, but whether the CTL turnover and what
the eﬀect these cells provide still need further research.

Immune changes in inﬂuenza
Diﬀerent from the disappearance of MERS and SARS,
the inﬂuenza pandemic (H1N1) in 2009 been incorporated into seasonal strains. However, the inﬂuenza pandemic (H1N1) has a relatively high mortality rate [26]
compared to inﬂuenza A virus (IAV) and inﬂuenza B
virus (IBV) which are usually coved in seasonal strains
[27]. The inﬂuenza genome contains 8 segments and is
capable of both antigenic drift and shift, making small
nucleotide mutations and the exchange of genome segments respectively. Due to these characteristics, novel
antigens never existed in the human population to
make seasonal epidemics possible.
The manifestation of H1N1 infections ranged from
subclinical symptoms to signiﬁcant malaise with fever,
myalgias, and rhinorrhea, progressing to acute hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress. Extra-pulmonary
presentations like gastrointestinal, neurologic and cardiac dysfunction, have also been described in the
review [26]. Albeit pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus infection and host immunity patterns are incompletely
characterized, in the early response period, increased
plasma levels of IL-15, IL-8, and especially IL-6 may

Emerging Microbes & Infections

be markers of critical illness [28]. Another study [28]
mapped 41 healthy volunteer T cell responses to
inﬂuenza before and during infection and demonstrated that inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD4+ T cells correlate
with disease protection against inﬂuenza challenge in
humans. However, Kristin G.I. Mohn et al. [8] stimulated PBMC during acute and convalescent patients,
suggesting that signiﬁcantly lower frequencies of
inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD8+ compared with CD4+ IFN-γ
T-cells in acute patients, while high levels of both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directed against conserved
core antigens in convalescent patients. Considering
the lack of enough sample size and study design,
whether there is a discrepancy of T lymphocyte subgroups dominance in diﬀerent periods of infection
should be explored further, but the CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have been linked to disease severity [28,29].
It is noteworthy that in the seasonal inﬂuenza infection, peripheral lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte
subsets showed a signiﬁcant correlation with prognosis
of severe illness. Studies compared IAV or IBV patients
with healthy subjects, elevated serum IL-6, IL-8 level
and decreased CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, NK counts
related to patients infection [30,31].
As reviewed in this literature, the viruses of respiratory infections like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and
inﬂuenza virus all caused periodical outbreak and
death. Histopathological examinations show common
characteristics: diﬀuse alveolar damage, edematous
lung lesions and pneumonia [32–34]. Besides, the
examination of virus infection demonstrates that the
capability of virus replication eﬃciently in the upper
and lower respiratory tract is associated with mild or
moderate clinical signs and pathological changes [33–
35], though only in the MERS-CoV infected rhesus
macaque could detect transient lymphocyte cell
reduction in the ﬁrst 2 days after inoculation [33].
Jiang Gu et al. [36] hypothesized that the marked T
lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells) decline
weakened immune system and aggravated the SARS
infection of the respiratory tract. In summary, virus
replication, distribution and associated immune
response contributed to the progress of the infectious
disease. The change of peripheral lymphocyte change
and the transition of lymphocyte subgroups may provide new thoughts for the pathogenesis of SARSCoV-2 infection.

Hypothetical pathogenesis
Based on the published literature and clinical observations of COVID-19 patients, we propose reasonable
hypotheses about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2
infection in humans. The virus might pass through
the mucous membranes, especially nasal and larynx
mucosa, then enters the lungs through the respiratory
tract. The early most common symptoms of infection

729

are fever and cough [37]. The virus may enter the peripheral blood from the lungs, causing viremia. Then the
virus would attack the targeting organs that express
ACE2, such as the lungs, heart, renal, gastrointestinal
tract [38,39]. The SARS-CoV-2 detected in the fecal
samples [37] is more likely because the virus enters
the blood from the lungs and then travels from the
blood to the intestines, which supports our hypothesis.
Dawei Wang et al found that the median time from
symptom onset to ARDS was about 8 days [40]. We
speculate that in this way, the virus begins a second
attack, causing the patient’s condition to aggravate
around 7–14 days after onset. During the infection process, the white blood cell count in peripheral blood in
the early stage of the disease is normal or slightly low
[37], and lymphopenia is observed in patients [40].
We speculate that B lymphocyte reduction may occur
early in the disease, which may aﬀect antibody production in the patient. In severe type patients, lymphocytes were signiﬁcantly reduced [40]. We speculate that
lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 might gradually decrease as the disease progress. But the mechanism of signiﬁcant lymphocyte reduction in severe
type patients remains unclear. Besides, the inﬂammatory factors associated with diseases mainly containing
IL-6 [41] were signiﬁcantly increased, which also contributed to the aggravation of the disease around 7–14
days after onset. Non-survivors had higher levels of
neutrophils, D-Dimer, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine than the survivors [40].
Based on the above assumptions, the clinical phase
is divided into three: the viremia phase, the acute
phase (pneumonia phase) and the recovery phase.
If the immune function of patients in the acute
phase (pneumonia phase) is eﬀective, and no more
basic diseases, the virus can be eﬀectively suppressed,
then enter the recovery phase. If the patient is older,
or in an immune impaired state, combined with
other basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, the immune system cannot eﬀectively control
the virus in the acute phase (pneumonia phase), the
patient will become severe or critical type. As we
mentioned in our hypothesis, T cells, B cells were
further reduced, while inﬂammatory cytokines and
D-Dimer continued to increase in severe type
patients (Figure 1A). To enhance the immune function of patients and inhibit the formation of inﬂammatory factor storms, we proposed the following two
therapeutic measures.
COVID-19 does not have speciﬁc antiviral drug
treatment currently, so the treatment of the disease is
mainly focused on symptomatic treatment and oxygen
therapy. Inﬂammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets
are recommended to be monitored during the disease.
We suggest that IVIg and low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant therapy could be
given as early as possible when T cells, B cells,

into three phases according to the above conjecture. The Y-axis is the trend of T cells, B cells, inﬂammatory factors, D-Dimer and

inﬂammatory cytokines, and D-Dimer show the following trends: T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in
peripheral blood are signiﬁcantly lower than before;
inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are increased signiﬁcantly; coagulation parameters such as D-Dimer
increased abnormally; Chest CT indicates the expansion of lung lesions. In our recommendation, highdose IVIg at 0.3–0.5 g per kg weight per day could be
given for 5 days, which can interrupt the storm of
inﬂammatory factors at an early stage, enhance
immune function. A randomized controlled clinical
trial of IVIg in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has been initiated (NCT 04261426). Although
IVIG has shown eﬃcacy in the treatment of patients
with inﬂuenza [42] and SARS [43], we need more clinical data of COVID-19 patients as evidence.

LMWH anticoagulation therapy is especially recommended in the early stage of the disease. Infection
is a common cause of disseminated intravascular
coagulation. Inﬂammation, infection and other factors
can lead to excessive activation of coagulation. We have
observed in clinical that COVID-19 patients with
severe type may develop disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) (unpublished data). In COVID-19
patients with severe type, ischemic changes may
occur in the ﬁngers and toes (Figure 2). Anticoagulation therapy is recommended for COVID-19 patients
when the D-Dimer value is 4 times higher than the normal upper limit, except for patients with anticoagulant
contraindications. The recommended dose of LMWH
is 100U per kg weight per 12 h by subcutaneous injection for atleast 3–5 days. Clinicians should closely

monitor the indicators of laboratory examination of
patients to be alert for side eﬀects after anticoagulant
treatment.
In conclusion, the current treatment of COVID-19
patients with severe type and critical type is the key
to controlling the rising number of deaths. We recommend early initiation of IVIg and LMWH anticoagulant therapy, which is eﬀective in improving the
prognosis of severe and critical type patients.
Figure 1B describes the optimal time to initiate IVIg
and LMWH anticoagulant therapy, as well as the possible trend of T cells, B cells, Inﬂammatory cytokines, DDimer after therapy. More immune-related research is
needed to help us understand the pathogenesis, guide
the treatment of the disease, and improve the
prognosis.
