Purpose: To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel
coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging ﬁndings of patients conﬁrmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The
clinical and imaging data were analyzed.
Results: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were signiﬁcantly (P<0.03) younger than either
common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients
were also signiﬁcantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low
to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%)
had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild
patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper
lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe
in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension
towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The
density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied
by partial consolidation and ﬁbrosis.
Conclusion: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of ﬁbrotic
stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.

The outbreak of an epidemical pneumonia with initially unknown reasons in December 2019 in Wuhan, China was ultimately
found to be caused by a new virus, the “2019 novel Coronavirus”
(2019-nCoV) or SARS-CoV-2 formally named by the World Committee on Virus Classiﬁcation,1–3 and the disease caused by this virus
was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization.4 , 5 This
virus has a characteristic crown representing the spike peplomers
on the viral envelope, with strong infectivity and general susceptibility to people of all ages and across the globe. On the 8th February 2020, the disease was named as “Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
(NCP)” in China.6 By February 16, 2020, China had reported a cumulative total of 70,548 patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2,
57,934 cases currently treated (10,644 severe cases), 1770 deaths,
10,844 cases being discharged from hospitals, 7264 suspected cases
and 546,016 cases in close contact including 150,539 people being
isolated and closely watched. The SARS-CoV-2 is primarily propagated through respiratory droplets and close contact, with the
incubation period usually between 1 and 14 days and the typical symptoms after onset of fever, dry cough, fatigue and gradual
appearance of dyspnea. People carrying this virus are the source
of infection even in the incubation period, and early diagnosis of
this disease or carrier of the virus is crucial to preventing it from
further spread. However, conﬁrmation of infection of this virus

requires presence of the virus nucleic acid detected in swabs, secretions and sputum from the respiratory tract, blood or stools.7
Nonetheless, detection of the virus nucleic acid may not be convenient, and early diagnosis of the NCP is essential for timely isolation and treatment of the patient. Computed tomography (CT)
is easily available and can be used to screen patients for rapid
conﬁrmation of SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP because CT, especially
high resolution CT, has the advantages of high spatial resolution,
freedom of disturbance from other structures outside the scanning
plane and ability to display every details of the lesion in multiple planes and directions. This study was performed to analyze the
clinical and CT imaging features in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP or COVID-19 and to familiarize radiologists and doctors
with the common clinical and CT imaging ﬁndings of this disease
for quick recognition, rapid isolation and treatment of the patient.
Materials and methods
This retrospective study was conducted in January and February
2020, and the ethics committee of our hospital waived written informed consent because of its retrospective and emergent nature
and evaluation of only the imaging and clinical data of the patients, involving no potential risk. Inclusion criteria were patients
infected with 2019-nCoV, positive nucleic acid of the virus and CT
scanning of the lung.
When patients were admitted, CT pulmonary scanning was performed for all patients with the high-resolution LightSpeed VCT
CT64 scanner (GE MEDICAL SYSTEMS, China Branch, Beijing, China).
The patient was in the supine position and scanned with breath
holding at the end of inhaling. The scanning range was from the
thoracic entrance to the level of posterior costophrenic anglem
with the scanning parameters of tube voltage 120 kV, with the
automatic milliampere technology (40–250 mA), noise index (NI)
25, pitch 0.984:1, matrix 512 × 512, slice thickness 5 mm, window
width/level 20 0 0/- 60 0 HU for the lung window, 350/40 HU for
mediastinal window, and slice thickness 0.625 mm for reconstruction of the lung window in the axial position.
Imaging analysis was performed by three experienced radiologists with over 10-year experience, and in case of disagreement,
they would consult to reach an agreement. The CT imaging was analyzed according to the following parameters: lesion distribution:
