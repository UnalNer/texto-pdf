Background An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan,
Hubei, China. People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with
COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19.
Methods We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU), Wuhan Children’s Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data,
symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19.
Results The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in
seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8),
increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8),
IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-γ (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill
patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in
ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home.
Conclusions In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by
fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine
storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19,
previously known as 2019-nCoV) caused by SARS-CoV-2
infection in Wuhan City, China, has spread around the world
[1]. As of 24 February, more than 77,262 confirmed patients
have been reported in China, and several patients have been
confirmed in 29 countries. Among the confirmed patients
in china, 9915 were severe patients and 2592 died [2]. In
addition, most of those who died had underlying health
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular
disease which compromised their immune system [3].
Previous studies have shown that patients with COVID19 present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue and lymphopenia. SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect elderly adult
men; and those with chronic comorbidities are at higher
risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death
in severe patients [4–6]. Infected children have relatively
milder clinical symptoms compared with infected adults
[7], and no deaths have been reported in the pediatric population up to now. Mildly affected pediatric patients have
been reported with an age of onset ranging from 17 days to
17 years [8]. However, specific information characterizing
severely affected pediatric patients remains unknown.
For better understanding of the clinical features of severe
pediatric patients with COVID-19 and for improving the
diagnosis and treatment, we aimed to describe epidemiological and clinical features, imaging data, laboratory findings,
clinical treatments and outcomes of severely or critically ill
pediatric patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China.
