ABSTRACT

Circulating in China and 158 other countries and areas, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has caused devastating mortality
and posed a great threat to public health. However, eﬀorts to identify eﬀectively supportive therapeutic drugs and
treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To
characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inﬂammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we
carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF) and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host
inﬂammatory cytokine proﬁles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19
pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the
cause of patients’ lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for
clinical guidance on anti-inﬂammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.

Introduction
The recent ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia
(COVID-19) has sparked worldwide concern. First
reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, COVID-19
spread rapidly across other areas and caused a major
epidemic with 80,894 conﬁrmed cases including 3237
deaths in China by 17 March 17 2020. A novel highly
infectious coronavirus, oﬃcially called the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), was subsequently identiﬁed as the causative
pathogen of this outbreak by deep sequencing and etiological investigations [1–3]. As global new cases spike
in 75 more countries apart from China, WHO has
declared that COVID-19 is currently a global public
health emergency. According to previous studies of
clinical characteristics, the most common symptoms
of SARS-CoV-2 infection are fever, cough, fatigue,
shortness of breath, and abnormalities on chest CT
[4–6]. However, some COVID-19 patients rapidly

develop severe pneumonia symptoms and complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), pulmonary oedema, acute kidney injury, or
multiple organ failure [4–6]. The case fatality rate of
COVID-19 is around 3.7% according to the national
oﬃcial statistics in China.
Despite increasing global threats of COVID-19, the
host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection
remains poorly understood. Viral RNAs are recognized
by the innate immune system through three major
classes of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors:
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors
(RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), which trigger
the expression of interferon (IFN) and activation of
anti-viral eﬀectors such as Natural Killer cells, T CD8
+ cells and macrophages [7–10]. Coronaviruses, such
as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have evolved strategies to
dampen or delay IFN production, which usually trigger
exuberant inﬂammatory host responses leading to

severe lung pathology [8,11–13]. It is believed that dysregulated host immune response and production of
inﬂammatory cytokines, known as the “cytokine
storm”, correlates with disease severity and poor prognosis during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection
[8,9,14]. Several proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CCL-2, CCL-3, RANTES, IL-2, and
IL-8 were aberrantly elevated during MERS-CoV infection of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived
macrophages [8,15]. Interestingly, recent studies have
reported that severe cases of COVID-19 exhibit
increased plasma levels of IL2, IL6, IL7, IL10, GSCF,
IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα compared with mild
cases, indicating inﬂammatory cytokine release is critical in COVID-19 progression [4,5]. Lymphopenia was
common in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, probably
due to lymphocytes induced apoptosis [4,5,16]. Furthermore, clinical pathological analysis of COVID-19
biopsy samples conﬁrmed interstitial mononuclear
inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in lung tissues [17]. However,
the underlying molecular mechanisms of the aberrant
inﬂammatory responses in serology and histopathology under SARS-CoV-2 infection are still not clear.
Transcriptomic analyses of cells upon virus infection
are extremely useful to identify the host immune
response dynamics and gene regulatory networks
[18,19]. In this study, we use RNA sequencing techniques
to investigate the transcriptional changes in BALF and
PBMC specimens of COVID-19 patients. Through transcriptomic analyses of these datasets, we identiﬁed several immune pathways and pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, notably
CCL2, CXCL2, CCL8, CXCL1, IL33, CCL3L1 in BALF
and CXCL10, TNFSF10, TIMP1, C5, IL18, AREG,
NRG1, IL10 in PBMC, evidencing a sustained inﬂammation and cytokine storm in the patients. KEGG pathway analysis of PBMC transcriptome revealed that
patient’s lymphopenia may be caused by activation of
apoptosis and P53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes.
Altogether, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced excessive cytokine release correlates with
lung tissue injury and COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Materials and methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. The RNA-seq
analyses of BALF samples and PBMC were performed
on existing samples collected during standard diagnostic
tests, posing no extra burden to patients.
Preparation of PBMC
Whole blood and PBMC (Ficoll preparation) were
obtained from 3 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 3 healthy

donors at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
Peripheral blood sample (4 ml) from each patient
and healthy control was drawn into vacutainer tubes.
The Ficoll density gradient centrifugation method
was used to separate the PBMC. We diluted the
blood with 1× phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) 1:1
and then transferred it to the ﬁcoll tube. After centrifugation (20 min, 1000× g, and room temperature), the
buﬀy coat of PBMC cells was pooled and transferred
into a 15-ml falcon. PBMC was then washed twice
with 10 ml PBS and centrifuged at 250× g for 10 minutes. The precipitate was collected and the total RNA
was extracted.
Preparation of BALF
2% lidocaine was injected into the segment of the lung
for local anesthesia. 100 ml fractions of room temperature sterile saline were instilled into the right middle
lobe or the left lingular segment of the lung. BALF
was retrieved by gentle syringe suction and put into
sterile containers.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated from cells and ﬂuid with TRIzol and TRIzol LS reagents respectively under the
instruction of the manufacturer.
RNA-seq library construction and sequencing
One microgram of total RNAs were used as input. Messenger RNAs were puriﬁed using oligo-dTs covalently
coupled magnetic beads. Then, the RNAs were fragmented into small pieces by heating. The expected
size was 180 nt to 250 nt. First-strand of cDNA was
synthesized in the presence of speciﬁc chemicals to
ensure that only RNAs were used as template. Double
strand cDNAs were puriﬁed with Agencourt AMPure
XP beads after the reaction. DNA library was constructed through end-repair, adaptor-ligation and
PCR ampliﬁcation. The intermediate products were
size-selected after the adaptor-ligation using two
rounds of Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Qualiﬁed
double-strand DNA library was transformed into
single-stranded circular DNA library through DNAdenaturation and circularization. DNA nanoballs
(DNBs) were generated from single-stranded circular
DNA using rolling circle ampliﬁcation (RCA). The
DNBs were qualiﬁed using Qubit 2.0. Qualiﬁed DNBs
were loaded on the ﬂow cell and sequenced with MGISEQ-2000 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, P. R. China) for 4
PBMC samples (P1-3 and N1). Another two PBMC
healthy samples (N2 and N3) were sequenced with Illumina NovaSeq platform. The RNA-seq data for BALF
healthy control samples (Ctrl1, Ctrl2, and Ctrl3) were
downloaded from the NCBI SRA database with

Emerging Microbes & Infections

accession numbers: SRR10571724, SRR10571730, and
SRR10571732 [20].
Data analysis
RNA-seq reads were ﬁrstly mapped to rRNA sequences
to remove potential rRNA reads using STAR (v2.7.2b)
[21] with the default parameter. The rest reads were
then mapped to the human genome (hg38) with
GENCODE gene annotation (v32) with parameters
“–sjdbScore 1 –outFilterMultimapNmax 20 –outFilterMismatchNmax 999 –outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.04 –alignIntronMin 20 –alignIntronMax
1000000 –alignMatesGapMax 1000000 –alignSJoverhangMin 8 –alignSJDBoverhangMin 1” following the
guideline of ENCODE RNA-seq pipeline (https://
github.com/ENCODE-DCC/long-rna-seq-pipeline).
The human un-mappable reads were then mapped to
the SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank MN988668) as
previously reported [3]. PCR replicates mapped in
the human genome were removed with picard MarkDuplicates program (v2.13.2-1) [22]. RNA-seq signal
tracks were generated by using bam2wig.py provided
in RSeQC package (v3.0.0) [23], and visualized in
UCSC genome browser [24] with custom track hub.
Gene expression was calculated by featureCounts in
SubReads package (v1.5.3) [25] with the “-M” parameter. Diﬀerentially expressed genes were called by
using DESeq2 package (v1.26.0) [26] with the following
criteria: adjusted p-value < 0.05 and fold-change > 2.
The expressed genes (requiring reads counts greater
than 10 and 100 for BALF and PBMC, respectively),
were selected and normalized to counts per millions
(CPM) for further analysis.
Functional enrichment analysis was performed on
the list of diﬀerentially expressed genes by using the
clusterProﬁler package (v 3.14.3) [27] to determine if
the genes are enriched for speciﬁc terms. The level of
signiﬁcance for the enrichment was calculated by a
hypergeometric test for each term using all expressed
genes as background. The p-values were corrected for
multiple hypothesis tests using the Benjamini and
Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate
(FDR). To inspect genes in speciﬁc GO-term and
pathway, the GO and KEGG pathway annotation
were downloaded from Gene Ontology Resource
(Last updated: 22 February 2020) [28] and KEGG
database (Last updated: 14 January 2020) [29],
respectively. The interacting proteins to the diﬀerentially expressed genes in PBMC or BALF were identiﬁed from the functional human network
InWeb_InBipMap (a human protein–protein interaction network with direct interaction evidence in
high-conﬁdence). Cytoscape (3.5.0) was used for
visualizing the PPI subnetwork.

Results
Quantitative transcriptome analysis of BALF
and PBMC from patients
To investigate the impact and mechanism of SARSCoV-2 infections in patients, we exploited RNA-seq
to detect transcriptome changes in both PMBC and
BALF samples from healthy donors and COVID-19
patients (Figure 1(A)). We got samples from
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, including
BALF samples from two patients (WHU01-2), and
blood samples from 3 patients (P1-3) and 3 healthy
individuals (N1-3). The data for 3 BALF healthy
samples (Ctrl1-3) were from a previous study
[20]. We utilized Ficoll density gradient centrifugation to isolate PBMC in the blood, followed by
RNA library construction and high-throughput
sequencing.
We performed quality control analysis on the RNAseq data, and summarized the statistics of reads
mapped to the human genome and the SARS-CoV-2
genome (GenBank MN988668) in the Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2 for BALF and PBMC samples, respectively. Consistent with our previous report focusing on
viral genome assembly [3], BALF patient samples contain high ratio of viral reads, while healthy control
datasets have zero counts. Interestingly, PBMC
samples from patients barely exhibit viral reads, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may not infect PBMC. The
data illustrated high consistency within control or
patients groups as demonstrated by the correlation
and clustering analysis of BALF and PBMC samples,
respectively (Supplementary Fig S1A and S1B).
For BALF samples, we detected 9609 expressed
genes, in which 679 genes are up-regulated and the
325 genes are decreased in patients compared with
healthy individuals (Supplementary Fig S2A). The
diﬀerentially expressed genes are represented in scaled
heatmap comparing patients to healthy controls for
both BALF (Figure 1(B) and Supplementary File 1)
and PBMC samples (Figure 1(C) and Supplementary
File 1). For PBMC samples, we found more genes
(15,726) with RNA expression signals, in which 707
genes are signiﬁcantly up-regulated while 316 genes
are down-regulated (Supplementary Fig S2B). Interestingly, as illustrated by the RNA-seq signals shown in
the genome browser, IL6 and IL6R are decreased in 2
out of 3 patients (Figure 1(D,E)), while TP53
expression shows an increased trend (Figure 1(F)),

although they are not identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly changed genes statistically.
In sum, our data provide a global and quantitative
resource for investigating the RNA regulation upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Functional enrichment analysis of regulated
genes
Virus infection may induce dynamic changes of gene
expression in speciﬁc cellular biological processes.
We performed gene functional enrichment analysis of
the diﬀerentially regulated genes in BALF and PBMC
to monitor the changes in cells of patients and healthy
persons. For BALF samples, the up-regulated genes are
related to invasion of the virus (Figure 2(A) and Supplementary File 2). Viral infection-induced changes
in various membrane structures and endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, the most enriched biological processes
are “cotranslational protein targeting to membrane”,
“protein targeting to ER”, and “viral transcription”.

However, up-regulated genes in PBMC are mainly
enriched in “complement activation”, “humoral
immune response mediated by circulating immunoglobulin”, and “B cell mediated immunity” (Figure 2(B)
and Supplementary File 2), indicating activated
immune activity in PMBC. In addition, a series of
inﬂammation-related processes was activated, such as
“regulation of acute inﬂammatory response” and
“acute inﬂammatory response” (Supplementary File 2).
Interestingly, the decreased genes in BALF of
patients are enriched in biological processes of “activation of immune cells” (Figure 3(A) and Supplementary File 3). In contrast, the decreased genes in PBMC
of patients are involved in other biological processes
such as “axon guidance”, “neuron projection guidance”
and “mRNA-related biological processes” (Figure 3(B)
and Supplementary File 3).
Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis was performed for these up- and down-regulated genes. In
BALF samples, the pathways enriching changed genes
include “Ribosome”, “Protein processing in

endoplasmic reticulum”, “Phagosome”, “Pentose phosphate pathway”, “Carbon metabolism”, and “lysosome”
(Figure 2(A) and Figure 3(A), Supplementary File 2
and File 3). For PBMC samples, “Cell cycle” and
“metabolism” pathways enrich up-regulated genes,
while cytokine-related pathways enrich down-regulated genes, such as “Viral protein interaction with
cytokine and cytokine receptor”, “NF−kappa B signaling pathway”, “Toll−like receptor signaling pathway”,
and “IL−17 signaling pathway” (Figures 2 and 3(B),
Supplementary File 2 and File 3). The interacting proteins to the diﬀerentially expressed genes in BALF and
PBMC were also identiﬁed from the functional human
network to obtain a global understanding of their interaction network (Supplementary Fig S3).
Analysis of regulated cytokines
According to previous clinical reports, COVID-19
patients have cytokine storm which is in reminiscence
of SARS-CoV infection [4,12,32]. We identiﬁed all
expressed cytokines in BALF (Figure 4(A)) and
PBMC (Figure 4(B)) with signiﬁcantly changed genes
marked by an asterisk. As in clinical cases, high cytokine expression was observed in the BALF. In agreement with laboratory ﬁndings, we found cytokines
IL10, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A,
and CCL4/MIP1B are highly expressed in patients’
BALF samples. Further comparison between the two

patients (WHU01 and WHU02) indicated the
expression of some cytokines, such as IL10, IL36RN,
IL36G, TNFSF15, CCL5, TNFSF10, CXCL1, and
IL33, are variable among patients.
SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause lymphocyte
apoptosis
Laboratory ﬁndings of the 3 patients (Supplementary
Table 3) indicated cell count reduction of various
types of immune cells including lymphocytes in
patients’ blood. Previous clinical and autopsy reports
indicated that patients’ lymphocytes have been greatly
reduced [5]. We found that several signiﬁcantly altered
genes are enriched to the apoptosis and P53 signaling
pathways (Figure 5), including CTSL, CTSB, DDIT4,
RRAS, CTSD, BIRC5, TNFSF10, CTSZ, NTRK1,
IGFBP3, CCNB1, RRM2, CCNB2, GTSE1, CDK1,
STEAP3, and TP53I3. Interestingly, TP53, an important gene in the process of apoptosis, shows an increasing trend in two patients, indicating that PMBCs
reduction may be due to apoptosis.
Comparing diﬀerently changed genes in BALF
and PBMC from patients
Based on the diﬀerential gene expression analysis, we
found that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the levels
of intracellular gene changes between the BALF

samples and PBMC. This distinction is due to diﬀerences in viral infections to the two types of cells. Of
note, the virus seems not to infect PBMC as that we
failed to detect viral RNAs as well as ACE2 expression
in PBMC (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), which was
also supported by the expression data base of bone
marrow-derived blood cells (http://www.altanalyze.
org). In order to illustrate the diﬀerences between the
two cell types, we classiﬁed genes with diﬀerent trends
between the BALF samples and PBMC (Figure 6(A,B)).
There are 17 genes that change in the same direction,
while 36 genes have opposite trends. We ﬁrst analysed
genes that increased in PBMC but decreased in BLAF.
Among the 15 genes, 5 genes are participated in small
molecule catabolic process: ADA2, HK1, MGAT1,
PGD and PLA2G15. And 4 genes are involved in neutrophil activation and immunity: ADA2, CTSD, GAA,
LAIR1 (Supplementary File 4). Next, we analysed genes
that increased in BLAF but decreased in PBMC, which
were listed in Figure 6(B). Although, there are 17 genes
changing in the same trend between the two samples,
the biological meaning still needs further investigation.

Discussion
The infection of SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe pulmonary disease and complications with signiﬁcant
morbidities and mortalities. Currently, there is no

optimal treatment or eﬀective drug for this fatal lung
disease. Our understanding of the host immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited, making
it diﬃcult to design novel therapeutics. Viral infection
usually causes massive alterations in the host transcriptome, leading to aberrant host cell metabolism and
modulated immune response which is ideal for viral
replication [12,33]. Using several patients’ and healthy
individuals’ BALF and PBMC samples, we performed
genome-wide RNA-sequencing to characterize the
host immune response in COVID-19 patients. We
found that 1004 and 1023 genes were diﬀerential
expressed (p < 0.05) when BALF and PBMC samples
of COVID-19 patients were compared to control,
respectively. As expected, these genes fall into categories including humoral immune response, lymphocyte mediated immunity and complement activation,
which all play important roles in restricting viral
infection.
Inﬂammatory response in viral pneumonia can be a
double-edged sword. Although beneﬁcial inﬂammation is necessary for the local tissues to ﬁght infection, exacerbated inﬂammatory responses in
pneumonia patients result in excessive release of proinﬂammatory cytokines known as “cytokine storm”,
leading to detrimental outcomes such as diﬀuse alveolar damage and ﬁbrosis, progressive respiratory failure
and multiple organ dysfunction[4,34,35]. The newly

emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus shares the same human
receptor ACE2 with SARS-CoV virus [1]. One of the
hallmarks of SARS disease are systemic inﬂammation
and cytokine storm with increased level of IL-6, IL-8,
CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL3/MIP-1A
[12,36]. Little is known about the immunopathology
of COVID-19 diseases. Recent clinical investigation
reveals that COVID-19 mild patients had high level
of IL1B, IFNγ, CXCL10/IP-10 and CCL2/MCP-1,
while patients requiring ICU admission had higher
level of GCSF, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1 and
CCL3/MIP-1A [4]. Consistently, in this study we
found the expression of a large number of cytokines

are signiﬁcantly elevated in COVID-19 patients BALF
samples compared to control, including pro-inﬂammatory cytokines CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL8,
CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1A and
CCL4/MIP1B. These data suggest SARS-CoV-2 virus
infection led to cytokine storm which correlated with
disease severity. Increased transcription of respective
chemokines receptors such as CCR2 (CCL2/MCP-1
receptor) and CCR5 (CCL3/MIP-1A receptor) was
also observed, indicating the activation of these inﬂammatory signaling. Cytokines/chemokines and their
receptors play an important role in the cytokine
migration and activation of immune cells at the sites
of infection [37]. It has been shown that CCR2 and
CCR5 deﬁcient mice infected with mouse-adapted
SARS-CoV virus exhibited defects in directing inﬂammatory cell to the airway, causing severe disease and
increased mortality [38]. In addition, our results reveal
that high levels of macrophages chemoattractant

chemoattractant CXCL2 and CXCL8 facilitate the
migration of these immune cells to the site of infection,
which was consistent with mononuclear cell inﬁltrates
in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients [17].
Induction of inﬂammatory cytokines is tightly controlled to prevent tissue damage and maintain a proper
immune homeostasis. It has been shown that proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-6, which is required for
the regulation of inﬂammatory response, B-cell diﬀerentiation and antibody production, was increased in
SARS patients [39,40]. Laboratory ﬁndings indicated
serum IL-6 protein level increased in 2 out of 3 patients
(Supplementary Table 3). However, IL-6 transcription
levels did not signiﬁcantly change in PBMC (Figure 1
(D) and Supplementary File 1), indicating that the
secreted IL-6 protein in serum might be from lung

epithelial cells. Very recently, administration of the
anti-IL-6-Rα antibody tocilizumab has been proposed
as a treatment in clinical practice by ameliorating
inﬂammation of COVID-19 patients. Of note, we
noticed that relatively lower expression levels of IL6R
was observed in BALF of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy individual (Supplementary File 1),
and there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in PBMC
(Figure 1(E) and Supplementary File 1), suggests that
IL-6/IL6R axis of cells in BALF and PBMC might not
be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease. A more comprehensive clinical study and larger
scale of transcriptome proﬁling with more cases is
needed to evaluate the justiﬁcation of anti-IL-6 mAb
treatment.
Moreover, we found that anti-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-b were also induced upon
SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, resembling the high
TGF-b activity found in SARS patients [34,41]. TGFb is a multifunctional cytokine which regulated a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation,
diﬀerentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses [42].
Additionally, TGF-b signaling can be modulated by
virus infection to block cell apoptosis and to promote
ﬁbroblast proliferation and myoﬁbroblast diﬀerentiation, thus plays a critical role in the development
of pulmonary ﬁbrosis [43]. Recently, COVID-19
patient’s lung biopsy has been shown mild ﬁbrosis
and moderate inﬂammation [17]. Our data suggests
that increased expression of TGF-b in COVID-19
patients might be the cause of pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
Lymphopenia have been found in a large portion of
SARS and COVID-19 patients, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear [4,6,44–47]. Viral
infection of lymphocytes was barely detected in SARS
patients [48]. Similarly, we have not observed any
viral gene expression in patients PBMC, indicating
SARS-CoV-2 virus may not infect lymphocytes in
COVID-19 patients. Among these 3 patients, autophagy, P53 and apoptosis pathways are highly expressed
in PBMC of COVID-19 patients compared with
healthy individual. Due to its anti-inﬂammatory
eﬀect, glucocorticoids have been widely used to stop
the progression of the acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS and COVID-19
patients by suppressing lung inﬂammation [4,49].
However, glucocorticoids treatment has been criticized
for its signiﬁcant side eﬀects including immunosuppression, impaired antibody responses, delayed viral
clearance and more severely, avascular necrosis and
osteoporosis [44,49–51]. Collectively, lymphopenia in
SARS and COVID-19 patients was more likely caused
by endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids which
ultimately led to apoptosis of lymphocytes, rather
than direct viral infection of these cells [44,50].
In summary, the present work demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2 virus infection stimulates a unique

transcriptome proﬁle in COVID-19 patients BALF and
PBMC. Additionally, the cytokine expression proﬁle
suggests excessive pro-inﬂammatory cytokine release
might be a hallmark of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the COVID-19 patients BALF and PBMC
RNA-seq dataset provides a useful resource to the community for further thorough analyses.
