The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has
now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that
relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric
specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the
community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl
was a close contact of her uncle and mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this
report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment
and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal
strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.

The current international outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019 and it has now spread to at least 60
countries.1,2 The World Health Organization escalated the risk assessment of COVID-19 to
‘very high’ at global level on February 28, 2020.3 As of March 01, 2020, there were 87,137
confirmed cases including 2,977 deaths worldwide.2 According to the report by the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, children are less affected with COVID-19 (1% for
under 10 years and 1% for between 10 and under 20 years of age) and seem to have less severe
disease than adults.4
Within one month of the first case of COVID-19 in Korea, a 10-year-old girl, who had no
travel history outside Korea, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 18, 2020. The
exposure history and self-quarantine method is shown in Fig. 1. The patient lived with
her mother, father, and cousin in a multiplex housing unit, and her uncle and aunt lived
upstairs. The patient's uncle, who ran a store in Wuhan, arrived in Korea on January 20,
2020, and had self-quarantined in his room from January 29, 2020. During quarantine
period, he broke self-quarantine by having meals with his family members. On February
1, 2020, her uncle was confirmed with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in a designated
hospital. From February 2, 2020, self-quarantine was resumed by the remaining five family
members. Although the patient's father, aunt and cousin stayed in separate rooms, the
patient shared the same room with her mother. On February 5, 2020, her mother was
confirmed with COVID-19. Because the patient closely contacted her uncle and her mother,
she was screened for COVID-19, and three screening tests for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were all negative on day 1 and 4 since her uncle's
diagnosis (February 1) and day 2 from the last exposure (February 5) to her mother. She
remained well without subjective symptoms until the 13th day from the last exposure when
she developed slightly elevated temperature of 37.3°C, which led to a confirmed diagnosis of
her COVID-19 on February 18, 2020. A small amount of sputum for the previous three days
was later reported. No other symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting were reported.
On admission, she was not dyspneic nor cyanotic with a body temperature of 37.7°C. Initial
laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,080/μL (37.3% lymphocytes),
hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet count 251,000/μL, and C-reactive protein < 0.40 mg/dL.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2
(Supplementary Data 1) was serially tested for the samples from nasopharynx, throat, saliva,
