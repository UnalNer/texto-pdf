The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has
now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that
relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric
specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the
community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl
was a close contact of her uncle and mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this
report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment
and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal
strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.

The current international outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019 and it has now spread to at least 60
countries.1,2 The World Health Organization escalated the risk assessment of COVID-19 to
‘very high’ at global level on February 28, 2020.3 As of March 01, 2020, there were 87,137
confirmed cases including 2,977 deaths worldwide.2 According to the report by the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, children are less affected with COVID-19 (1% for
under 10 years and 1% for between 10 and under 20 years of age) and seem to have less severe
disease than adults.4
Within one month of the first case of COVID-19 in Korea, a 10-year-old girl, who had no
travel history outside Korea, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 18, 2020. The
exposure history and self-quarantine method is shown in Fig. 1. The patient lived with
her mother, father, and cousin in a multiplex housing unit, and her uncle and aunt lived
upstairs. The patient's uncle, who ran a store in Wuhan, arrived in Korea on January 20,
2020, and had self-quarantined in his room from January 29, 2020. During quarantine
period, he broke self-quarantine by having meals with his family members. On February
1, 2020, her uncle was confirmed with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in a designated

hospital. From February 2, 2020, self-quarantine was resumed by the remaining five family
members. Although the patient's father, aunt and cousin stayed in separate rooms, the
patient shared the same room with her mother. On February 5, 2020, her mother was
confirmed with COVID-19. Because the patient closely contacted her uncle and her mother,
she was screened for COVID-19, and three screening tests for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were all negative on day 1 and 4 since her uncle's
diagnosis (February 1) and day 2 from the last exposure (February 5) to her mother. She
remained well without subjective symptoms until the 13th day from the last exposure when
she developed slightly elevated temperature of 37.3°C, which led to a confirmed diagnosis of
her COVID-19 on February 18, 2020. A small amount of sputum for the previous three days
was later reported. No other symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting were reported.
On admission, she was not dyspneic nor cyanotic with a body temperature of 37.7°C. Initial
laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,080/μL (37.3% lymphocytes),
hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet count 251,000/μL, and C-reactive protein < 0.40 mg/dL.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2
(Supplementary Data 1) was serially tested for the samples from nasopharynx, throat, saliva,

serum, stool, and urine. Viral tests were positive in the samples from nasopharynx, throat,
and stool (Fig. 2A). Serum, saliva, and urine tested negative on hospital days 3 and 8. Because
the RT-PCR was developed for the qualitative assay, the cycle threshold values of RT-PCR
could not be converted to viral load kinetics in this report. It is noteworthy, however, that
stool samples were positive until the 17th day since symptom onset.
No infiltrations were noted on the initial and 3 follow-up chest X-ray images (Fig. 2B).
However, chest computed tomography (CT) showed patchy or nodular consolidations with
peripheral ground glass opacities in subpleural areas of the right lower lobe (Fig. 2C). The
patient had no underlying disease and the only symptoms she presented with were low-grade
fever and a small amount of sputum. Although chest CT showed mild pneumonia, antiviral
therapy was not required.

First Pediatric Case of COVID-19 in Korea

This 10-year old girl took care of herself during the first 7 days spent alone in a negative
isolation room. When her mother was discharged from her own negative isolation room,
her mother joined her for care. She was transferred to a cohorting facility on the 15th
hospital day to allow her isolation room to be used by another confirmed case in a more
severe condition.
Very little research on COVID-19 in children has been published in China or elsewhere. Most
of the COVID-19 cases in children resulted from close contacts with COVID-19 cases or were
found among family cluster cases.5,6 Most of the infected children had mild or difficult to
recognize symptoms and some were even asymptomatic. Fever and cough were the most
common symptoms, and some had runny nose, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as
diarrhea, or vomiting. All of the cases improved, and no deaths have been reported so far.
We do not fully understand why children are less infected and less ill. Low infection rate
and mild symptoms in children have also been observed in the previous SARS epidemic
in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) since 2012.7-9 One of the
explanations of COVID-19 sparing the pediatric populations might be because children are
less exposed to the virus in the first place. Children are less likely to be exposed to the virus
because this novel virus is initially transmitted among travelers and their close contacts.
Children might also have fewer chances to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 because they only
present mild symptoms similar to common cold. Meanwhile, the role of innate immunity
to respiratory tract infection is greater in early life because the adaptive immune response
is underdeveloped in young children.10 Given that both young children and adults lack
adaptive specific immunity to this novel virus, mild clinical course in young children may be
explained by their dominant innate immune response compared to adults. Weaker ability
to trigger an acute inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 might also contribute to the
children's better outcome. This, however, does not completely rule out the possibility of
severe cases and even death especially in children with underlying diseases, as observed in
the previous MERS epidemics.8,9
Korea is now experiencing significant outbreaks and became the most-affected country after
China.2 The nation's biggest cluster has connections to Shincheonji religious group in Daegu.
Another worrisome cluster has been linked to the patients hospitalized in Daenam Hospital
in Cheongdo.11 Viral tests are being run on massive scales in Korea. Thus, we may be able to
diagnose more pediatric cases compared to other countries and have a unique opportunity to
define the clinical features of COVID-19 in the pediatric population and the role of children
in the transmission in child-care settings, schools and the community. Starting from several
imported cases from Wuhan in January 2020, subsequent human-to-human transmissions
occurred initially among their close contacts and family members. However, as the community
spreads progress, we will see more cases among children. Among 3,526 confirmed cases, as
of March 1, 2020, 164 children and adolescents under 20 years of age were diagnosed with
COVID-19, comprising approximately 4.7% of the total confirmed cases.11 The percentage of
the confirmed child cases in Korea is higher than that in China and has risen from 1.5% to
4.7% in just one week. These findings are worrisome. It is well known that children contribute
to the community spread of seasonal influenza by introducing influenza to the family and by
disseminating influenza in the community.12 To mitigate community spread of COVID-19, all
school closures are justified in the current situation in Korea. To provide a scientific evidence
for the effectiveness of school closures, we should not miss the opportunity to learn children's
role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 to the community.

First Pediatric Case of COVID-19 in Korea

It is interesting to note that although this case had mild symptoms only, patchy or nodular
consolidations with peripheral ground glass opacities were observed on chest CT. A recent
study in China analyzed the CT images of 15 children with COVID-19, 10 of whom were
asymptomatic and 5 had fever.13 Among the 15 children, pulmonary inflammatory lesions
were observed in 9. Small nodular ground glass opacity was the most common finding and
subpleural patchy opacities were also observable, with all lesions limited to a single lung
segment. Adults generally have ground-glass and consolidative opacities in both lungs
at chest CT.14 Chest CT is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool to detect pneumonia and the
sensitivity for COVID-19 is reported to be 97.5%.15 However, considering the favorable clinical
course in children with COVID-19, the necessity of performing CT scans on children should
be judged with consideration of the potential health risks of radiation.
Meanwhile, one of the issues regarding pediatric patients with COVID-19 is quarantine.
While in self-quarantine, the present patient shared the same room with her mother who was
soon confirmed with COVID-19. Ideally, any close contacts should stay at home in a separate
room and refrain from going out. However, unlike adults, self-isolating young children by
themselves is almost impossible because infants and young children must be taken care of
by their caregivers. Considering the circumstances, the Korean Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the Korean Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommend one
of the family members to be assigned as a caregiver for infants and young children who
are suspected or confirmed with COVID-19, and the caregiver not to contact other family
members.16 Most importantly, caregivers should take all possible precautions to avoid being
exposed to the virus. Thus, further pediatric-specific guidelines on the isolation and adequate
personal protective equipment for caregivers should be prepared.
This 10-year old girl is the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. As this is only a single
case, we cannot say much about clinical manifestations of childhood COVID-19 and viral load
as a whole but can provide a model to pediatricians on which samples to test and what to
consider in caring for children with COVID-19. As the number of confirmed cases surges in
Korea, data on pediatric patients need to be comprehensively analyzed to further describe the
clinical findings and to learn the role of children in a COVID-19 pandemic.
