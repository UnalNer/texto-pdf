Based on the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Infected
Pneumonia (Trial Edition 5), combined with our current clinical treatment experience, we recently
proposed a revision of the first edition of “Guidance for maternal and fetal management during
pneumonia epidemics of novel coronavirus infection in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital”. This article
focused on the issues of greatest concern of pregnant women including severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnostic criteria, inspection precautions,
drug treatment options, indications and methods of termination of pregnancy, postpartum fever,
breastfeeding considerations, mode of mother-to-child transmission, neonatal isolation and advice
on neonatal nursing, to provide valuable experience for better management of SARS-CoV-2
infection in pregnant women and newborns.
Key words: COVID-19; pneumonia; pregnant women; newborn; disease management

Since December 2019, Wuhan-Hubei province,
China has successively found several cases of patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). With
the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such cases have been
found in other regions of China and abroad, and
some areas have found cases with no travel history
in Wuhan. This disease has been incorporated into
the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Law
of the People’s Republic of China on the Prevention
and Control of Infectious Diseases and measures for
the prevention and management of Class A infectious
diseases have been adopted.
On February 5, 2020, the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China
issued the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for
Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia hereinafter referred to as the “Fifth Edition of
Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme”), which pointed
out that asymptomatic patients could also spread the
virus. Most patients had fever, fatigue, dry cough as
the mainly manifested symptoms and a few patients
had nasal congestion, runny nose, diarrhea and other
symptoms, while several cases had no obvious fever.
The total number of leukocytes in peripheral blood in
the early stage of disease was normal or reduced, the
lymphocyte count was generally decreased, and chest
CT presented NCP’s imaging features[2].
Special attention should be paid to the different
requirements of Hubei Province and other provinces
in terms of the epidemic’s situation, the diagnostic
criteria of the disease, and the detection, reporting
and exclusion of cases. In addition to suspected and
confirmed cases, clinically diagnosed cases have been
added in Hubei Province. As long as the suspected cases
have NCP’s imaging features, they would be treated
as clinically diagnosed cases and handled according to
the severity of clinical classification. Once suspected
cases and clinically diagnosed cases are found in Hubei
Province, they would be immediately quarantined,
treated, and specimens taken for pathogenic testing as
soon as possible.
