Recommendations for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF$

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, speciﬁc recommendations are required for the
management of patients with gynecologic cancer.
Materials and method: The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and
Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference
model.
If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be
postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy
could replace surgery as ﬁrst-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over
primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval
surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early
stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral
adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be
postponed for 1–2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1–2
endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm
(combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic
lymphadenectomy.
Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to
limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.

These recommendations are based on current knowledge but
may evolve as new data emerges.
In the current pandemic context of COVID-19 and the
subsequent saturation of resuscitation services, over the next 2–
3 months we must not only reconsider our therapeutic indications
but also limit the risk of infection in our cancer patients. To reduce
the risk of infections two priorities are crucial: to limit high risk
situations such as surgery and chemotherapy; and to limit the
patient’s contact with healthcare workers and, in particular, with
places of care.
While bearing in mind that the main objective for our patients
with pelvic gynecologic cancer remains therapeutic management,
all alternatives to surgery must be considered. In particular, the
risk-beneﬁt ratio for surgical procedures must be analyzed on a
case-by-case basis and in multidisciplinary meeting, taking into
