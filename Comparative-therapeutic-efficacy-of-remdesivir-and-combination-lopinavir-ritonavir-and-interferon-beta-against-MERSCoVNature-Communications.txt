Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the causative agent of a
severe respiratory disease associated with more than 2468 human infections and over 851
deaths in 27 countries since 2012. There are no approved treatments for MERS-CoV infection
although a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFNb) is currently being evaluated in humans in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Here, we show that
remdesivir (RDV) and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and RTV in vitro. In mice,
both prophylactic and therapeutic RDV improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral
loads and severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb slightly reduces
viral loads without impacting other disease parameters. Therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb
improves pulmonary function but does not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology.
Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential for RDV to treat MERS-CoV infections.

he coronavirus (CoV) family has a propensity for emergence into new hosts often causing novel severe disease. In
2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), was discovered as the causative agent of a severe
respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), has
since caused at least 2468 cases and 851 deaths globally1. MERSCoV is endemic in camels, the zoonotic reservoir host, with
evidence of infection going back at least 30 years2. Camels in the
Middle East and perhaps in East Africa continue to seed human
infections which may require hospitalization especially in aged
individuals with preexisting comorbidities1,3,4. Similar to severe
acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV has
spread to over 27 countries via air travel of infected people5. In
2014, a single imported case caused an outbreak of 186 cases in
South Korea, while a more recent case imported from the Middle
East was contained as a result of rapid implementation of public
health measures6. MERS-CoV continues to cause human infections globally and thus is listed as a priority pathogen with
pandemic potential by World Health Organization (WHO) and
the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).
Presently, there are no approved treatments for MERS-CoV or
any other human CoV.
Emerging viral diseases typically have very few if any effective
treatment options. As such, treatments designed and approved
for other diseases are administered to patients with emerging viral
syndromes empirically based on limited clinical or laboratory
data. Multiple U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved therapies have been evaluated for antiviral activity
against MERS-CoV in vitro including lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir
(RTV), and interferon beta (IFNb). LPV is a human immunodeﬁciency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor that is usually
combined with RTV to increase LPV half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome P4507. Although the antiviral activity of
LPV against MERS-CoV has been reported in Vero cells (concentration causing a 50% reduction in replication (EC50) = 8 µM),
other studies report complete inactivity similar to that of RTV8,9.
In contrast, studies evaluating the antiviral activity of type I and
type II interferons have reported IFNb as the most potent
interferon (EC50 1.37–17 IU/mL) in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro8,10. The only in vivo study assessing the therapeutic efﬁcacy of LPV/RTV or IFNb against MERS-CoV
published thus far was performed in common marmosets where
modest improvements in clinical outcomes were noted11. In
human MERS-CoV patients, two published case reports describe
conﬂicting results on the use of a combination of LPV/RTV,
pegylated interferon, and ribavirin with one of two patients
surviving12,13. To this end, a randomized control trial (MIRACLE
Trial) aimed at conclusively determining if LPV/RTV-IFNb
improves clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV patients was initiated
in 2016 and has thus far enrolled 76 patients in KSA14,15.
Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a broad-spectrum antiviral
nucleotide prodrug with potent in vitro antiviral activity against a
diverse panel of RNA viruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV),
Marburg, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), Nipah virus (NiV), and Hendra virus16–18. The mechanism of RDV’s anti-MERS-CoV activity is likely through premature termination of viral RNA transcription as shown in
biochemical assays using recombinant EBOV, NiV, and RSV
polymerases18–20. In primary human lung epithelial cell cultures,
RDV is potently antiviral against circulating contemporary
human CoVs, SARS-CoV (EC50 = 0.07 µM), MERS-CoV (EC50
= 0.07 µM), and related zoonotic bat CoVs17,21. We recently
reported that therapeutic RDV improves disease outcomes and
reduces viral loads in SARS-CoV-infected mice17. Since similar
studies had not been performed with MERS-CoV, we generated a
transgenic mouse with a humanized MERS-CoV receptor
2

(dipeptidyl peptidase 4, hDPP4) and deleted for carboxylesterase
1c (Ces1c) to improve the pharmacokinetics of nucleotide prodrugs such that it better approximates the drug exposure proﬁle
in humans22. Here, we show that RDV provides superior antiviral
activity against MERS-CoV in vitro and in vivo as compared with
LPV/RTV-IFNb. In addition, RDV was the only therapeutic
treatment to signiﬁcantly reduce pulmonary pathology. Thus, we
provide in vivo evidence of the potential for RDV to treat MERSCoV infections.
Results
RDV and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and
RTV. We utilized a recombinant MERS-CoV engineered to
express a reporter nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC) for our in vitro
antiviral activity assays. To ensure that our reporter virus behaved
similarly to WT MERS-CoV, we ﬁrst demonstrated that MERSnLUC and wild-type (WT) MERS-CoV EMC 2012 strain replicate to similar levels in the absence of drug treatment and are
similarly susceptible to the antiviral activity of RDV (WT EC50 =
0.12 µM; MERS-nLUC EC50 = 0.09 µM) in the human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3 (Supplementary Fig. 1). These data are in
agreement with those for WT MERS Jordan strain (EC50 =
0.3 µM) reported by Warren et al.18. Thus, future reporter virus
data should be representative of WT MERS-CoV.
We then performed parallel antiviral assays in Calu-3 cells with
MERS-nLUC comparing LPV, RTV, IFNb, and RDV (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Fig. 2)17. Similar to our previous reports, RDV
showed potent inhibition of MERS-CoV replication with a EC50
of 0.09 µM, no observable cytotoxicity up to 10 μM and a
selectivity index (SI = EC50/CC50) > 10017. (Fig. 1a). In contrast,
the respective EC50 values generated for LPV and RTV were 11.6
and 24.9 µM with CC50 values >50 µM (Fig. 1b, c). Thus, the SI
for LPV and RTV was > 4.3 and > 2, respectively. Combination
LPV and RTV (LPV:RTV, 4.6:1 molar ratio) is currently under
evaluation in the MIRACLE trial14. The antiviral activity of LPV/
RTV (EC50 = 8.5 µM) was similar to LPV alone (EC50 = 11.6 µM,
P = 0.43, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), suggesting
the effect was largely driven by LPV (Fig. 1d). We found potent
inhibition of MERS-CoV with IFNb (EC50 = 175 international
units (IU)/mL) (Fig. 1e), CC50 values >2800 IU/mL and an SI >
16. Together, these data demonstrate that RDV and IFNb have
superior in vitro antiviral activity compared with LPV and RTV,
and that RTV does not signiﬁcantly enhance the antiviral activity
of LPV in vitro.
IFNb activity is not improved when combined with LPV/RTV.
Cell culture medium and human plasma have different concentrations and types of proteins, which directly affects the levels
of biologically available free drug unbound to protein complicating the comparison of drug levels the respective systems23. To
address this issue, we utilized comparative equilibrium dialysis
(CED) to determine the differences in free unbound drug between
human plasma and cell culture medium revealing that the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) in human plasma (15 µM) had
the same amount of free unbound LPV as 5 µM LPV in 10% FBS
containing cell culture medium. Thus, we combined LPV (5 µM)
and RTV (1.09 µM) at a ﬁxed molar ratio of 4.6:1 in combination
with increasing concentrations of IFNb. The antiviral activity of
the LPV/RTV-IFNb combination (EC50 = 160 IU/mL) was
indistinguishable from that of IFNb alone (EC50 = 175 IU/mL)
(P = 0.62, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test) (Fig. 1f).
These data suggest that the observed in vitro antiviral activity of
the LPV/RTV-IFNb combination on MERS-CoV is dominated by
IFNb when LPV/RTV is used at clinically relevant concentrations.

Fig. 1 RDV and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and RTV. Graphs depict mean % inhibition of MERS-CoV replication (left Y-axis) and %
cytotoxicity (right Y-axis) of antivirals. Calu-3 cells were infected in sextuplicate with MERS-CoV nanoluciferase (nLUC) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 0.08 in the presence of a dose response of drug for 48 h, after which replication was measured through quantitation of MERS-CoV–expressed nLUC.
Cytotoxicity was measured in similarly treated but uninfected cultures via Cell-Titer-Glo assay. Representative data are shown from four independent
experiments.

A MERS-CoV mouse model for the testing of nucleotide prodrugs. Unlike humans, mice have high levels of a serum esterase
(carboxylesterase 1c, Ces1c) that drastically reduces the stability of
RDV in mice requiring efﬁcacy studies be performed in Ces1c−/−
mice to better approximate the pharmacokinetics and drug
exposure proﬁle in humans17. MERS-CoV infection of standard
laboratory mice is prevented due to differences in human and
mouse dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the entry receptor for
MERS-CoV. To enable testing of RDV in mice, we bred Ces1c−/−
mice with mice harboring a modiﬁed DPP4 humanized via
CRISPR/Cas9 at residues 288 and 330 (hDPP4). The resultant
Ces1c−/− hDPP4 mice had indistinguishable virus replication and
pathogenesis from hDPP4 mice when infected with MERS-CoV
(Supplementary Fig. 3)22,24.

Prophylactic RDV diminishes MERS-CoV replication and
disease. Using the new Ces1c−/− hDPP4 mouse model, we sought
to determine if prophylactic RDV could ameliorate MERS-CoV
disease. As shown in Fig. 2a, prophylactic RDV (25 mg/kg, BID)
administered 1 day prior to infection signiﬁcantly diminished
MERS-CoV-induced weight loss in mice infected with 5E + 04
(P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison
test) or 5E + 05 plaque-forming units (pfu) (P < 0.0001, two-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test) as compared
with similarly infected vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, RDV
administered prior to infection also prevented mortality (P =
0.0037, Mantel–Cox test) in those administered a lethal dose (i.e.,
5E + 05 pfu) (Fig. 2b). In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, lung
hemorrhage was signiﬁcantly reduced (P < 0.0001, two-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test) with RDV
prophylaxis (Fig. 2c)22,25,26. Importantly, RDV prophylaxis signiﬁcantly reduced virus lung titers > 3 logs on both 4 (5E + 04
P = 0.0240, 5E + 04 P = 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Sidek’s
multiple comparison test) and 6 days post infection (dpi) (5E +
05 P = 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Sidek’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 2d), which was corroborated by viral antigen
labeling in lung tissue sections (Fig. 2e).

RDV prophylaxis reduces features of ALI. The American
Thoracic Society (ATS) issued a consensus document with
deﬁned parameters and tools to more accurately translate small
animal models of acute lung injury (ALI) to the human condition26. Using the ATS Lung Injury Scoring System designed to
quantitate histopathological features of ALI (Fig. 3a), we blindly
scored ﬁelds of hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissue sections
from the mice in Fig. 2 for the following features: neutrophils in
the alveolar and interstitial space, hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris ﬁlling the air spaces, and alveolar septal thickening26. As compared with control mice, the ATS lung injury scores
were signiﬁcantly reduced in RDV-treated mice (P = 0.0079,
Mann–Whitney test) infected with 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV and
approached statistical signiﬁcance (P = 0.0536, Mann–Whitney
test) in those infected with the higher virus dose (5E + 05 pfu)
(Fig. 3a). In Fig. 3, we also show examples of the quantitated
pathological features. In normal healthy mock-infected control
mice (Fig. 3b), the alveolar air spaces are free of debris and
inﬂammatory cells, the walls (i.e., septae) of the alveolar sac are
thin which facilitates efﬁcient gas exchange and rare neutrophils
in circulation are seen in the capillaries within alveolar septae, but
not in the air spaces. In contrast, vehicle-treated MERS-CoVinfected animals in both viral dosage groups (Fig. 3c) had multiple histologic features of ALI including notable immune cell
inﬁltration into the alveolar septae and resultant septal wall
thickening, scattered degenerating and dying cells, proteinaceous
debris in the air spaces resulting from capillary leakage some of
which is organized into hyaline membranes and neutrophils in
alveolar septae as well as in the air spaces. Interestingly, the early
hyaline membranes (i.e., thin pink material lining alveoli) were
noted in vehicle-treated animals infected with the lower dose of
MERS-CoV (Fig. 3c, left), while more developed hyaline membranes (i.e., thick pink material lining alveoli) were observed in
vehicle-treated animals infected with the higher dose of virus
(Fig. 3c, right). Importantly, the air spaces of RDV-treated animals infected with the lower dose of MERS-CoV (Fig. 3d, left)
predominantly lacked cellular debris, immune cells, and hyaline
membranes although alveolar septal thickening due to increased

immune cells was observed. RDV-treated animals infected with
the higher dose of MERS-CoV (Fig. 3d, right) similarly lacked
debris and inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in the air spaces, but exhibited
increased alveolar septal thickening. Thus, our blind pathological
evaluation of lung tissue sections using the ATS Lung Injury
Scoring System demonstrates that prophylactic RDV diminished
the pathological features of ALI in MERS-CoV-infected mice26.

The minimal effect of prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb on MERSCoV. Prophylactic studies provide a best case scenario to evaluate
in vivo antiviral activity since time is given for the metabolization
and accumulation of antiviral agents within cells targeted by virus
prior to infection. To determine if prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb
improved outcomes following MERS-CoV infection, we ﬁrst
conﬁrmed that subcutaneous human equivalent doses (H.E.D.) of
IFNb exerted a biological effect in mice. Administration of a 1 × ,
2.5x, or 25x H.E.D. of mouse IFNb rapidly induced dosedependent expression of interferon stimulated gene (ISG), Mx1,
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in Ces1c−/− mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Importantly, the kinetics of Mx1 gene
expression in target organ of MERS-CoV, the lung, was similar in
both Ces1c−/− and Ces1c−/− hDPP4 mice (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). Similarly, a single dose of IFNb signiﬁcantly induced
sustained expression (P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Sidek’s
multiple comparison test) of interferon gamma-induced protein
10 (IP-10, CXCL-10) in the serum of both strains of mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Thus, we observed an expected
4

ISG response in the blood and lung tissue of both Ces1−/− and
Ces1−/− hDPP4 mice following IFNb treatment.
We then evaluated if LPV/RTV-IFNb prophylaxis could
improve outcomes in Ces1−/− hDPP4 mice infected with 5E +
04 pfu MERS-CoV. We compared vehicle (oral: propylene glycol
and ethanol, subcutaneous: PBS) to three different treatment
scenarios, including LPV/RTV-IFNb high (25x H.E.D. IFNb),
LPV/RTV-IFNb low (1x H.E.D. IFNb), or IFNb-high alone (25x H.
E.D. IFNb) (Fig. 4). Prophylactic RDV and vehicle were included
as controls. Since ISG expression peaks 2–4 h after IFNb
administration (Supplementary Fig. 4), we initiated IFNb dosing
2 h prior to MERS-CoV infection to maximize the potential
antiviral effect. Similar to our previous studies, RDV (25 mg/kg,
BID) or vehicle were administered subcutaneously every 12 h to
obtain exposures in mice similar to that observed in humans17.
The dosing levels and frequencies of LPV/RTV (oral once daily)
and IFNb (subcutaneously every other day) were chosen to mirror
those in the MIRACLE trial27. Unlike RDV-treated mice (Fig. 4a),
vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb, or IFNb alone did not prevent weight loss
(Fig. 4b). In fact, animals administered IFNb alone lost
signiﬁcantly more weight than vehicle (P = 0.01), LPV/RTV-IFNb
high (P = 0.0001) and low (P = 0.006, all two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s multiple comparison test) groups (Fig. 4b). On 6 dpi, RDV
treatment reduced virus lung titers the most (>3 log reduction,
vehicle median = 1.4E + 05 pfu/lobe, RDV median = 50 pfu/lobe)
(Fig. 4a), while those in LPV/RTV-IFNb low treated were modestly
reduced (~4-fold, median = 5.5E + 03 pfu/lobe) as compared with
its vehicle (median = 2.3E + 04 pfu/lobe) (P = 0.04, two-way

Fig. 3 Remdesivir prophylaxis reduces features of acute lung injury. The histological features of acute lung injury were blindly scored using the American
Thoracic Society Lung Injury Scoring system creating an aggregate score for the following phenotypes: neutrophils in the alveolar and interstitial space,
hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris ﬁlling the air spaces, and alveolar septal thickening. Three randomly chosen high power (×60) ﬁelds of diseased
lung were assessed per mouse. Representative images are shown for mock infected as well as those administered prophylactic vehicle or RDV and infected
with either 5E + 04 or 5E + 05 pfu mouse adapted MERS-CoV. The numbers of mice scored per group: Vehicle 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV N = 5, Vehicle
5E + 05 pfu MERS-CoV N = 3, RDV 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV N = 5, RDV 5E + 05 pfu MERS-CoV N = 5. Symbols identifying example features of disease
are indicated in the ﬁgure. All images were taken at the same magniﬁcation. The black bar indicates 100 µm scale. For the graph, the boxes encompass the

ANOVA with Sidek’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 4b). Upon
measuring pulmonary function by whole-body plethysmography
(WBP), we found only RDV prophylaxis improved pulmonary
function (Fig. 4a, b) (P = 0.002 to 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with
Sidek’s multiple comparison test). Interestingly, animals receiving
IFNb-alone had signiﬁcantly worse pulmonary function than
companion groups at later times post infection (4–5 dpi, P = <
0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test). To
determine if initiation time or dose level would affect outcomes in
the IFNb only group, we performed a similar study but
administered IFNb at a lower dose (i.e., 1x H.E.D.) 24 h prior to
infection (Supplementary Fig. 5). Alteration of IFNb dose or time
of administration did not improve outcomes from those in Fig. 4,
and the modest improvement in virus titer seen with LPV/RTVIFNb noted above was not observed. Taken together, prophylactic
LPV/RTV-IFNb caused modest reductions in lung viral load in
one of two studies, but had minimal impact on other disease
metrics while IFNb alone did not impact virus replication and
exacerbated disease.

Therapeutic RDV reduces MERS-CoV replication and pathology. To more stringently assess the therapeutic potential of RDV
and LPV/RTV-IFNb and to better model the human scenario
where MERS-CoV patients most likely would initiate treatment
after infection, we performed a series of therapeutic efﬁcacy
studies in mice. We initiated the following treatments in Ces1−/−
hDPP4 mice infected with 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV on 1 dpi:
RDV or vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb low (1× human equivalent),
LPV/RTV-IFNb high (25× human equivalent) or their vehicles.
Dose route, amount, and frequency were similar to the prophylactic studies above. Only therapeutic RDV substantially reduced
body weight loss (P = 0.019 to < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 5a, b) and lung hemorrhage on 6 dpi (Fig. 5c) (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with
Kruskal–Wallis test). Similarly, only RDV treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced virus lung titers on 6 dpi (vehicle median 7.8E + 05 pfu/
lobe, RDV median 125 pfu/lobe, P = 0.0001, one-way ANOVA
with Kruskal–Wallis test) (Fig. 5d), which we corroborated with
viral antigen labeling in lung tissue sections (Fig. 5e). Similar

high only (n = 9). Oral vehicle or lopinavir/ritonavir (160/40 mg/kg) were administered orally once daily beginning the −1 dpi. IFNb treatment was
initiated 2 h prior to infection and every other day thereafter. To control for dosing effects, vehicle-treated mice received both LPV/RTV vehicle and
subcutaneous PBS to mirror IFNb injections. Likewise, IFNb only group received oral vehicle to mirror that seen in orally dosed groups. Similar statistical
tests performed on a were performed on b. For the box and whisker plots, the boxes encompass the 25th to 75th percentile, the line is at the median, while
the whiskers represent the range.

therapeutic studies (Supplementary Fig. 6) were performed but
with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV (5E + 05 pfu) where no treatment improved survival (Supplementary Fig. 6a, d) or lung
hemorrhage (Supplementary Fig. 6b, e), but therapeutic RDV
signiﬁcantly reduced lung viral load on 6 dpi (Supplementary
Fig. S6c) (P = 0.03, Mann–Whitney test). Thus, therapeutic LPV/
RTV-IFNb failed to improve weight loss, lung hemorrhage, and
virus lung titer after 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV and did not
improve survival following a lethal dose of MERS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 6d–f). In contrast, therapeutic RDV diminished
weight loss, lung hemorrhage, and virus replication during an
ongoing MERS-CoV infection, but the degree of clinical beneﬁt is
dependent on viral dose and time of treatment initiation.
Therapeutic RDV and LPV/RTV-IFNb improve pulmonary
function. In the therapeutic antiviral efﬁcacy studies described in
Fig. 5, we used WBP to assess pulmonary function (Fig. 6). In
contrast to vehicle-treated animals, RDV-treated animals had
reduced ﬂow rate at 50% of the expired volume (EF50) (P = 0.01,
two-way ANOVA with Sidek’s multiple comparison test), and
PenH (P = 0.04, two-way ANOVA with Sidek’s multiple comparison test), a surrogate measure of airway resistance/obstruction (Fig. 6a)28. Similarly, Rpef (the fraction of expiration before
peak expiratory ﬂow is reached), an indicator of bronchoconstriction, returned to baseline in RDV-treated animals by 5 dpi
(P = 0.002, two-way ANOVA with Sidek’s multiple comparison
6

test) yet remained suppressed in vehicle-treated animals.
Unlike the prophylactic study in Fig. 4b, therapeutic LPV + RTVIFNb low improved pulmonary function as compared with
vehicle with signiﬁcantly reduced EF50 and PenH (P < 0.05, twoway ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test) and baseline levels of Rpef by 5 dpi (P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 6b). While therapeutic
LPV/RTV-IFNb failed to reduce weight loss, lung hemorrhage,
and virus titer, this regimen appears to provide improvements in
pulmonary function similar to therapeutic RDV.
Therapeutic RDV but not LPV/RTV-IFNb diminishes signs of
ALI. We then quantitated the lung pathology in therapeutically
treated animals (Fig. 7). In lung tissue sections from the 6 dpi, we
blindly evaluated and scored features of ALI using three different
and complementary approaches. In Fig. 7a, we show reduced ALI
with RDV treatment. Although sporadic apoptotic cells and
alveolar septal wall thickening (~2–4-fold over mock) driven by
immune cell inﬁltration were observed in the lungs of mice
treated with therapeutic RDV, the air spaces remained predominantly free of cellular debris and inﬂammatory cells similar
to mock-infected animals (Fig. 7a). In contrast, multiple pathological features typical of ALI were noted in both vehicle groups
(RDV and LPV/RTV vehicles) as well as both LPV/RTV-IFNb
low and high, including altered alveolar architecture due to
pneumocyte degeneration and death, numerous inﬂammatory

cells in the septae and in alveolar air spaces, neutrophils in the air
spaces, and proteinaceous debris in the air spaces organizing into
hyaline membranes (Fig. 7a). Using the ATS ALI scoring tool
described in Fig. 3, we found that only RDV therapy signiﬁcantly
(P = 0.005, one-way ANOVA with Kruskal–Wallis test)
decreased lung injury scores (Fig. 7b). With a complementary
histological tool, we then quantitated features of diffuse alveolar
damage (DAD), the pathological hallmark of ALI26. We found
that only therapeutic RDV reduced DAD scores (P = 0.04, oneway ANOVA with Kruskal–Wallis test) (Fig. 7c)29. Since degree
of cell death appeared to correlate with protective efﬁcacy, we
quantitated levels of cleaved caspase-3 in lung tissue sections by
antibody labeling. Caspase-3, a widely accepted marker of
apoptosis, is a regulatory enzyme whose cleavage and activation
drive programmed cell death30. Using the Deﬁniens software
suite, we obtained unbiased quantitative data showing that only
RDV treatment signiﬁcantly reduced levels of cleaved caspase-3
antigen (P = 0.0109, one-way ANOVA with Kruskal–Wallis test)
(Fig. 7d). Thus, using three complementary and blinded
approaches, we obtained similar data showing that only therapeutic RDV reduced histologic features of ALI.
Discussion
Emerging viral diseases have caused signiﬁcant global pandemics
(e.g., HIV, 1918 inﬂuenza, smallpox), epidemics (e.g., SARS-

CoV), and devastating outbreaks (e.g., EBOV, MERS-CoV). For
CoV, metagenomic studies in wild animals have revealed a great
diversity of viruses and hosts, and have even identiﬁed viruses
similar to current and past epidemic strains in bats31,32. Thus,
broad-spectrum therapies effective against known epidemic and
zoonotic strains likely to seed future emergence, have the
potential to diminish epidemic disease today and diminish future
outbreaks. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for
any human CoV infection. Upon emergence of SARS- and
MERS-CoV, patients were administered off-label antivirals (e.g.,
ribavirin, LPV, RTV) and immunomodulators (e.g., corticosteroids, interferon alpha-2a/2b, IFNb) as single agents or in combination in an attempt to ameliorate severe disease outcomes with
very limited success33. Without randomized controlled trials,
determining efﬁcacy is difﬁcult due to patient and treatment
variability as well as a lack of appropriate matching controls.
Although recent meta-analysis and modeling has suggested that
interferon treatment does not improve clinical outcomes in
MERS-CoV patients4, the MIRACLE trial in the KSA is aimed at
conclusively determining if a ﬁxed dose combination of LPV/
RTV-IFNb is effective at treating MERS-CoV infections14. Here,
we show that RDV provides superior antiviral activity against
MERS-CoV in vitro and in vivo as compared with LPV/RTVIFNb. In addition, RDV was the only treatment to signiﬁcantly
reduce pulmonary pathology. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence
of the potential for RDV to treat MERS-CoV infections. Efﬁcacy

Fig. 6 Therapeutic RDV and LPV/RTV-IFNb improve pulmonary function. Whole-body plethysmography (WBP) was used to assess pulmonary function
in mice. Representative WBP data for one of the two studies depicted in Fig. 5 are shown. All groups were N = 4 per day. EF50 is the ﬂow rate at 50%

testing of antiviral regimens in humans like those in the MIRACLE trial are essential to progress antiviral development and
prioritize therapies most likely to improve clinical outcomes in
MERS-CoV patients.
Differences in protein identity and concentration complicate
the translation of in vitro antiviral activity to in vivo therapeutic
efﬁcacy. Although the EC50 for LPV against MERS-CoV (EC50 =
11 µM) falls within the maximum (Cmax = 15 µM) and minimum
(Cmin = 9.5 µM) levels observed in human plasma, the biologically available fraction unbound to protein in these respective
systems should be compared to more accurately translate in vitro
activity to potential in vivo efﬁcacy9. For example, the trough
levels (Cmin) of total (5.8 µM) and unbound protein free LPV
(0.057 µM) in women with HIV differ by 100-fold, but LPV is still
highly active and effective since the EC50 (0.010–0.027 µM) falls
below the unbound protein free Cmin7,34. Together, these data
argue that levels of free biologically active LPV achieved in
humans are well below those that exert robust antiviral effects on
MERS-CoV replication in cell culture systems. Thus, the micromolar EC50 observed for LPV against MERS-CoV coupled with
protein binding and insufﬁcient levels of free LPV in plasma is
likely responsible for the modest antiviral effect with LPV/RTVIFNb prophylaxis and minimal impact on disease with therapeutic administration in our mouse model. In contrast, human
equivalent doses of RDV are demonstrably efﬁcacious in mice
infected with SARS- and MERS-CoV and in nonhuman primates
infected with EBOV thus demonstrating a more suitable PK/PD
relationship17.
Interferons are useful in treating multiple viral infections35,36.
Since IFNb was shown to be the most potent against MERS-CoV
when comparing the antiviral activity of multiple type I and type
8

II interferons in Vero cells, IFNb was selected to use in the
MIRACLE trial8,10. Mirroring the MIRACLE trial, we delivered
IFNb subcutaneously every other day, which failed to reduce
MERS-CoV viral loads and appeared to exacerbate disease in
mice. As we sought to understand this result, we found little
experimental congruency among reports detailing the prophylactic or therapeutic efﬁcacy of type I interferons in animal
models of MERS-CoV11,37,38. Falzarano et al. demonstrated that
IFN-alpha-2a coupled with ribavirin initiated 8 h post infection
improved outcomes in rhesus macaques and reduced viral copy
number in lung tissue, but the treatment had no effect on
infectious virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid37. In mice
where hDPP4 is delivered to lung tissue by adenoviral transduction, intranasal IFNb given before or after MERS-CoV infection
reduced lung titers although the peak lung titers in this model are
approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the current
transgenic models, and thus may be more easily treated38–40. The
utility of the common marmoset as a model of MERS-CoV
pathogenesis is controversial with one study detailing severe
respiratory disease yet another reporting similarly mild disease
among mock and MERS-CoV-infected animals41,42. In marmosets, Chan et al. explored the therapeutic potential of LPV/RTV or
IFNb, but the small numbers of animals used per group, lack of
time-matched viral load samples, and unexpected early mortality
in the LPV group made the resultant data difﬁcult to interpret11.
Nevertheless, the studies noted above demonstrate that type I
interferon can exert an antiviral effect on MERS-CoV in vivo
when given subcutaneously (IFN alpha, rhesus macaque) and
intranasally (IFNb, adenovirus hDPP4 model)37–39. Our inability
to reduce MERS-CoV titer or improve outcomes with IFN as
described above may be due to inherent differences in the animal

models, delivery route, differences in IFN subtype and/or active
viral antagonism of innate immunity. Since recent studies have
demonstrated type III IFN to be most effective in ameliorating
inﬂuenza pathogenesis in mice, comparative studies investigating
the potency of different IFN subtypes should be pursued with
MERS-CoV43–45.
Acute lung injury (ALI) in humans is well deﬁned by a set of
clinical parameters (i.e., acute onset, diffuse bilateral inﬁltrates on
X-ray, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired
oxygen < 300, no evidence of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, etc.), which can be measured in mice but require specialized
procedures, equipment, and training not readily available to most
researchers26,46. Moreover, animal models of ALI typically fail to
recapitulate all pathologic features observed in humans likely due
to differences in underlying anatomy, physiology, immunology,
genetics, and complex comorbidities typically associated with
hospitalized ALI patients (e.g., diabetes, kidney and liver disease,
etc.)26. For example, mice have a distinctly different lobar composition with less branching in the conducting airway than
humans, a resting respiratory rate far exceeding that of humans
(250–300 bpm in mice, 12–16 bpm in humans), and very different
amounts of neutrophils in circulation (10–25% in mice, 50–70%
in humans). To address these issues, the American Thoracic
Society (ATS) has created tools to simplify the translation of
mouse models of ALI to the human condition including those to
quantitate the hallmarks of ALI in tissue sections26. We employed
a complementary quantitative histologic assessment tool for diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the pathological hallmark of ALI in
humans26,29. With the ATS ALI and DAD histologic assessment
tools described above, along with quantitation of cell death via
cleaved caspase-3 antigen labeling, we show that only RDV
therapy reduced ALI when initiated 1 dpi. Therefore, the evidence
from several complementary histologic approaches demonstrate
that RDV provides superior protection from ALI as compared
with LPV/RTV-IFNb.
Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a broad-spectrum antiviral with
potent in vitro efﬁcacy against multiple genetically unrelated
RNA viruses16–18. RDV has demonstrated in vivo efﬁcacy against
EBOV in nonhuman primates which has led to its inclusion in
clinical studies evaluating the effects of RDV treatment in acute
Ebola virus disease (EVD) as well as in EVD survivors with
prolonged viral shedding47,48. As with our SARS-CoV studies
with RDV, here we provide similar evidence for MERS-CoV with
diminished weight loss, improved pulmonary function, and
reduced virus replication with both prophylactic and therapeutic
RDV17. The kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV replication and
disease in mice is substantially accelerated as compared with that
in humans. Virus replication in the lung peaks at 2 dpi in the
lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and
infection progresses to mortality or recovery by 7–10 dpi,
depending on virus dose17,24. Therefore, the therapeutic window
in which to treat mice prior to the peak of virus replication is only
1–2 days. In contrast, MERS-CoV replication in the human
respiratory tract peaks at 7–10 days after the onset of symptoms
and the disease course resolves or progresses to death within
~21 days49,50. Thus, the window for therapeutic administration
after the onset of symptoms but prior to the peak of virus
replication is very different in humans and experimentally
infected mice. With therapeutic RDV, we observed decreased
MERS-CoV pathogenesis and signiﬁcant reductions in viral titers,
yet therapeutic treatment did not completely abrogate disease. In
addition, with high-titer virus inoculum, RDV was unable to
prevent mortality and loss of pulmonary function although it did
signiﬁcantly reduce viral loads. These results are similar to those
obtained for SARS-CoV, where therapeutic treatment initiated
after peak virus titer and lung damage failed to improve outcomes
10

yet signiﬁcantly reduced viral titer17. Similar observations were
recently reported where neutralizing monoclonal antibodies failed
to reduce severe lung disease pathology or clinical disease when
administered 1 day after MERS-CoV infection in marmosets51.
Since disease resulting from both SARS- and MERS-CoV infection is driven by both virus and host immune response factors,
depending on the stage of the disease progression, early initiation
of antiviral therapy, and/or holistic combination therapies will
likely be needed to diminish virus replication, immunopathology,
and/or promote repair and restoration of pulmonary homeostasis. Ongoing and future studies are aimed at determining if
MERS-CoV is capable of generating resistance to RDV in vitro
and whether the mutational spectra are similar to those obtained
by MHV and SARS-CoV which shift EC50 values only 3–5-fold52.
In summary, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential utility
of RDV in treating MERS-CoV patients. Overall, our work suggests that RDV may improve disease outcomes in CoV-infected
patients, serve to protect health care workers in areas with
endemic MERS-CoV and prove valuable in preventing future
epidemics in the event of novel CoV emergence in the future.
Methods
Study design. The primary goal of this study was to compare the prophylactic and
therapeutic efﬁcacy of RDV with the combination of LPV/RTV and IFNb. First, we
assessed antiviral efﬁcacy and cytoxicity in the Calu-3 human lung cell line as
compared with the appropriate vehicle control. Experimental conditions in vitro
were performed in sextuplicate unless otherwise stated, and antiviral assays were
repeated four times per drug. Second, we evaluated the in vivo efﬁcacy of prophylactic RDV as compared to vehicle with two different doses of MERS-CoV in a
new transgenic mouse model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis with improved pharmacokinetics for nucleotide prodrugs. We performed two additional prophylactic
studies comparing RDV and vehicle to LPV/RTV-IFNb, IFNb-alone, and their
vehicles. Third, we assessed the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the above treatment regimens in a mouse model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, but did not include an IFNb,
only arm and these studies were performed twice. All lung histological assessments
were performed in a blinded manner. In addition, we performed a single therapeutic efﬁcacy study with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. Our in vivo efﬁcacy studies
were designed to mirror the ongoing MIRACLE human clinical trial which is
evaluating combination LPV/RTV-IFNb. Our studies were intended to generate the
data required to justify further testing in nonhuman primates and collectively
inform future human clinical trials. Mice were age- and sex-matched and randomly
assigned into groups before infection and treatment. Exclusion criteria for in vivo
studies were as follows: If a given mouse unexpectedly did not lose weight after
infection and their virus lung titers were more than 2 log10 lower than the mean of
the group, this indicated that infection was inefﬁcient, and all data related to that
mouse were censored.
Animal care and ethics statement. Efﬁcacy studies were performed in animal
biosafety level 3 facilities at UNC Chapel Hill. All works were conducted under
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UNC
Chapel Hill (IACUC protocol #16-284) according to guidelines set by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Virus. For in vitro studies, a MERS-CoV reporter virus expressing nanoluciferase
was employed (MERS-nLUC)17. MERS-nLUC stocks were derived from a molecular clone through electroporation of Vero 81 cells (ATCC CCL-81) and isolation
of virus through harvesting of culture supernatants53. Brieﬂy, DNA fragments A–F
encoding MERS-nLUC cDNA genome were ligated to create full-length cDNA,
which was then used as a template for in vitro transcription. Full-length genomic
RNA was then electroporated into Vero-81 cells yielding recombinant virus stock.
The resultant stock was passaged twice in Vero 81 to generate a working stock
(1.6E + 07 pfu/mL) for our studies. Wild-type MERS-CoV for comparative antiviral efﬁcacy studies was derived from our EMC 2012 infectious clone as described
above to obtain a working stock with a titer of 3E + 07 pfu/mL53. For in vivo
studies, we utilized mouse adapted MERS-CoV passage 35 clone 4 (MERS M35C4)24.
MERS M35C4 has 12 amino acid coding changes as well as a single-nucleotide
change in the 5ʹ UTR and a large deletion in ORF4b/ORF5. This virus is a clonal
isolate generated through serial passage of MERS-CoV in mice. After 35 passages in
mice, virus was plaque puriﬁed and clone 4 was expanded two times on Vero
CCL81 cells to obtain our working stock. The working stock (1.1E + 08 pfu/mL)
was created in virus collection medium (Optimem (Gibco), 3% Fetal Clone II
serum product (Hyclone), and antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco) and non-essential
amino acids (Gibco)).

Compounds and formulation for in vitro studies. Remdesivir (RDV), lopinavir
(LPV), and ritonavir (RTV) were solubilized in 100% DMSO and provided by
Gilead Sciences, Inc. Recombinant human interferon beta (IFNb) protein was
purchased from R&D Systems (8499IF010/CF, 2.8 × 108 IU/mg compared with
WHO standard) and solubilized in sterile water as recommended.
In vitro efﬁcacy and cytotoxicity in Calu-3 cells. To determine if virus replication kinetics and RDV susceptibility were similar among wild-type (WT) MERSCoV EMC 2012 and MERS-nLUC, we performed comparative antiviral assays the
human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3 2B4 (kindly provided by Dr. Chien Tseng
University of Texas Medical Branch). Calu-3 2B4 was maintained in the DMEM
(Gibco), 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), and 1× Antibiotic–Antimycotic
(A/A, Gibco). Brieﬂy, 48 h prior to infection, Calu-3 cells were plated at 4.3E + 04
cells/well. Twenty-four hours prior to infection, culture medium was exchanged
with fresh medium. Calu-3 2B4 cells were infected with WT EMC 2012 or MERSnLUC at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 37 °C after which cells
were washed, and a dose response of RDV diluted in twofold steps in media
(DMEM, 10% FBS, DMEM, 1x A/A) was added in duplicate. Cells were then
incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h after which 100 µl of media from each well
was collected and assayed for virus production by plaque assay in Vero
CCL81 cells. Brieﬂy, 500,000 Vero CCL81 cells/well were seeded in six-well plates.
The following day, medium was removed, and serial dilutions of sample were
added per plate (10−1–10−6 dilutions) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, after which
wells were overlayed with 1× DMEM, 5% Fetal Clone 2 serum, 1× A/A, 0.8%
agarose. Three days after, plaques were enumerated to generate a plaque/ml value.
The IC50 value was deﬁned in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad).
To better understand the antiviral activities of RDV, LPV, RTV, IFNb, or
combinations of LPV/RTV or LPV/RTV/IFNb, we performed efﬁcacy and
cytotoxicity assays in human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3). Cells were plated as
described above, and infected with MERS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase (MERSnLuc) in sextuplicate at an MOI of 0.08 for 1 h in the presence of a dose response of
drug as described below. After 1 h of infection, virus was removed, cultures were
rinsed once with medium, and fresh medium was added containing dilutions of
drug. RDV (i.e., GS-5734, stock at 20 mM) was serially diluted in 100% DMSO in
twofold increments to obtain a ten-point dilution series. Human IFNb (R + D
Systems, 200 µg/mL or 5.6 × 107 IU/mL) was similarly diluted in PBS. LPV (10 mM
stock) and RTV (10 mM stock) were similarly diluted in DMSO, although various
amounts of stock compound were added directly to media to obtain the top four
dilutions in the ten-point curve (50 µM, 25 µM, 12.5 µM, 6.25 µM). To model the
antiviral effect of the ﬁxed dose combination of LPV/RTV used to treat HIV, we
performed antiviral assays with a ﬁxed combination of LPV/RTV (weight:weight
ratio of 4:1 or molar ratio 4.6:1). The LPV/RTV combination was serially diluted in
100% DMSO in twofold increments, but mixture stock was added directly to the
media similar to above to obtain the top four concentrations. These studies were
repeated in 4 independent experiments.
To model LPV/RTV in combination with IFNb, we ﬁrst performed comparative
equilibrium dialysis (CED)23 and determined that 5 µM LPV in 10% FBS
containing cell culture medium gave the same amount of free (i.e., unbound to
protein) LPV as the maximum concentration attained in human plasma (Cmax, i.e.,
15 µM). We then combined a dose response of human IFNb with a ﬁxed
concentration of LPV/RTV (molar ratio of 4.6:1, (5 µM Lopinavir and 1.1 µM
Ritonavir) based on the human plasma equivalent maximal concentration of LPV
as determined by CED (i.e., 5 µM). Thus, this study was aimed at determining if the
maximal amount of LPV attainable in humans provided an additive or synergistic
antiviral effect when combined with IFNb. All studies were performed in cell
culture medium containing 10% FBS. DMSO (0.5%) was constant in all conditions.
At 48 h post infection (hpi), virus replication was quantiﬁed on a Spectramax
(Molecular Devices) via nanoluciferase assay (NanoGlo Promega). Values from
replicate wells per condition were averaged and compared with controls to generate
a percent inhibition value for each drug dilution. The IC50 value was deﬁned in
GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad) as the concentration at which there was a 50%
decrease in viral replication using UV-treated MERS-nLUC (100% inhibition) and
vehicle alone (0% inhibition) as controls. To measure cytotoxicity, cells were
exposed to the same drug dilutions and controls as the efﬁcacy studies, but in the
absence of virus infection. After 48 h of exposure, cell viability was determined by
Cell-Titer-Glo Assay (Promega) and quantitated on a Spectramax. Similar data was
obtained in at least three independent experiments.
Formulations for in vivo studies. RDV was solubilized at 2.5 mg/ml in vehicle
containing 12% sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin sodium salt in water (with HCl/
NaOH) at pH 5.0. LPV (32 mg/mL) RTV (8 mg/mL) was solubilized in vehicle
containing 90% propylene glycol and 10% ethanol. The ratio of LPV to RTV was
held at 4:1 (weight:weight) for all studies herein. Recombinant mouse IFNb protein
was purchased from R&D Systems (8234-MB/CF, 1.2 × 109 IU/mg calibrated
against Murine IFN-beta WHO International Standard) for the in vivo studies and
reconstituted in PBS.

mouse ortholog prevent infection of mice. We recently developed a mouse model for
MERS-CoV through the mutation of mouse DPP4 at 288 and 330 via CRISPR/
Cas9 thus humanizing the receptor (hDPP4) and rendering mice susceptible to
MERS-CoV infection22. The serum carboxylesterase 1c (Ces1c) in mice drastically
reduces RDV stability. Thus, all in vivo studies must be performed in mice genetically deleted for Ces1c (Ces1c−/−, stock 014096, The Jackson Laboratory)17. In order
to perform in vivo efﬁcacy studies with RDV and MERS-CoV in mice, we generated
humanized DPP4 mice deﬁcient in Ces1c expression (C57BL/6J Ces1c−/− hDPP4,
The Jackson Laboratory stock number 403188). Brieﬂy, our C57BL/6J hDPP4 mouse
was rederived using Ces1c−/− oocytes. The resultant heterozygous mice were crossed
with Ces1c−/− mice to generate mice homozygous for the Ces1c deletion (Ces1c−/−)
and heterozygous for the hDPP4 alleles. The resultant offspring were genotyped and
bred to generate founders homozygous for both Ces1c−/− and hDPP4.
MERS-CoV pathogenesis in Ces1c−/− and hDPP4 mice. To determine if the
pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in Ces1c−/− and hDPP4 was similar to the parental
hDPP4 line, we performed pathogenesis studies in the newly created Ces1c−/− and
hDPP4 line. Similar numbers (N = 9–10/sex/group) of 23–24-week-old male and
female mice were randomly assigned to each infection group. Mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and then intranasally infected with
either 5E + 04 or 5E + 05 pfu MERS M35C4 in 50 µl virus collection medium. To
monitor morbidity, mice were weighed daily out to 6 dpi. Mice that lost >20% of
their starting weight were humanely sacriﬁced by isoﬂuorane overdose. To better
understand the magnitude of MERS-CoV replication and the typical metrics of
disease, we infected 12 9–12-week-old female mice with 5E + 04 MERS M35C4 in
50 µl virus collection medium as done above. To monitor morbidity, mice were
weighed daily. A subset of each cohort was randomly assigned for pulmonary
function measurements by whole-body plethysmography (WBP, Data Sciences
International) daily28. On 6 dpi, animals were killed by isoﬂurane overdose, lungs
were scored for lung hemorrhage, and the inferior right lobe was frozen at −80 °C
for viral titration via plaque assay as described above22. Lung hemorrhage is a gross
pathological phenotype readily observed by the naked eye driven by the degree of
virus replication where the coloration of the lung changes from pink to dark
red25,26. The large left lobe was placed in 10% buffered formalin and stored at 4 °C
for 1–3 weeks, until histological sectioning and analysis. Lung sectioning, hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as MERS-CoV antigen (primary antibody 1:500,
sera from mice vaccinated with MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen) staining was
performed by the Animal Histopathology & Laboratory Medicine Core at UNC.
Interferon beta pharmacodynamic studies. To generate a pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship for IFNb, we subcutaneously administered mouse IFNb (R + D Systems) to 18–20 week-old male and female Ces1c−/−
or Ces1c−/− hDPP4 mice. Human equivalent dosing in mice was calculated based
on the recommended dosing strategy for Betaseron (human IFNb, 0.13 million
international units (MIU)/kg every other day)54. The human dose was multiplied
by 12.3 in order to get the mouse equivalent dose of 1.6 MIU/kg or 4.8E4 IU/30 g
mouse (40 µg/30 g mouse) based on body surface area55. First, we compared 1× and
2.5× human equivalent doses of IFNb in cohorts (N = 20/group) of Ces1c−/− mice.
At 2, 4, 8, and 12 h post treatment, ﬁve mice per group were humanely euthanized,
and plasma was snap-frozen at −80 °C, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were isolated, place in Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher) and stored at −80 °C
until analysis. Second, we compared the responses to a 25× human equivalent dose
of IFNb (i.e., 40 MIU/kg or 1.2 MIU/30 g mouse (1000 µg/30 g mouse)) in Ces1c−/−
or Ces1c−/− hDPP4 mice (N = 25/group) to ensure that these mouse lines respond
similarly. At 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h post treatment, mice were humanely euthanized
and plasma and PBMCs were isolated and stored as noted above. In addition, lungs
were isolated at 4 and 8 h post treatment and stored in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher)
at −80 °C until analysis. The total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using Zymo
Research Direct-Zol RNA mini kit. Lung tissue was homogenized in Trizol
(Thermo Fisher), and the total RNA was isolated similarly to PBMCs. The response
to IFNb treatment in PBMCs was quantitated by qRT-PCR for the classic interferon stimulated gene MX dynamin-like GTPase 1 (Mx1) by TaqMan assay
(Thermo Fisher Mm00487796_m1) using the Taqman Fast Virus 1-Step Master
Mix (Thermo Fisher). Mx1 gene expression was compared with signals from the
housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Thermo
Fisher, Mm99999915_g1) and fold change over mock or time 0 post treatment was
calculated by the ΔΔCt method56. To monitor induction of interferon induced
protein expression, we quantitated levels of mouse IFN-gamma inducible protein
10 (IP10, CXCL-10) in plasma via ELISA (Invitrogen).
Prophylactic in vivo efﬁcacy studies. For all drug studies, mice that lost >20% of
their starting weight were weighed twice and subjected to an additional visual check
each day for clinical signs (hunching, ease of mobility, lethargy, etc.). Mice that fell
<70% of their starting weight were immediately euthanized. Mortality was deﬁned
as unexpectedly ﬁnding mice dead in the cage.
Several prophylactic studies were performed to determine if drug regimens could
affect virus replication and/or disease progression. In the initial study, we only
compared RDV and vehicle. Brieﬂy, groups of 9–12-week-old male and female
Ces1c−/− hDPP4 were randomly assigned to groups (n = 7–9) and acclimated for

5–7 days at biosafety level 3 (BSL3). Treatment with vehicle (see above) or RDV
(25 mg/kg, BID subcutaneously) was initiated the day prior to infection. For MERSCoV infection, mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and
then intranasally infected with either 5E + 04 or 5E + 05 pfu MERS M35C4 in 50 µl
virus collection medium. To monitor morbidity, mice were weighed daily. On 4 or 6
dpi, animals were killed by isoﬂurane overdose, lungs were scored for hemorrhage
(described above), and the inferior right lobe was frozen at −80 °C for viral titration
via plaque assay as described above22. The large left lobe was placed in 10% buffered
formalin and stored at 4 °C for 1–3 weeks, until sectioning and histological analysis.
Lung sectioning, hematoxylin and eosin staining, as well as MERS-CoV antigen
staining as described above were performed by the Animal Histopathology &
Laboratory Medicine Core at UNC. Due to increased variability of infection and
outcomes in male mice, all following studies were performed in only female mice.
We then performed two prophylactic studies to ascertain whether LPV/RTVIFNb or IFNb alone could affect virus replication or disease progression. The
studies were designed to mirror therapeutic efﬁcacy studies. In the ﬁrst study, in
randomly assigned groups (n = 9–10) of 11–13-week-old Ces1c−/− hDPP4 female
mice, we compared vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb, or IFNb alone. All treatments were
initiated one day prior to infection. For MERS-CoV infection, mice were
anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and then intranasally infected
with either 5E + 04 pfu MERS M35C4 in 50 µl virus collection medium. A human
equivalent dose of a coformulation of LPV (160 mg/kg) and RTV (40 mg/kg) at
5 mL/kg was administered once daily via oral gavage. Groups receiving a 1× human
equivalent dose of IFNb (R + D Systems, 1.6 MIU/kg or 4.8E4 IU/30 g mouse
(40 µg/30 g mouse)) were dosed every other day via subcutaneous injection. To
control for potential vehicle effects in the LPV/RTV-IFNb groups, we administered
oral vehicle (90% propylene glycol and 10% ethanol) daily and subcutaneously
injected with PBS every other day. RDV (25 mg/kg) at 10 mL/kg was administered
twice daily via subcutaneous injection. As a control for RDV, an additional group
was given subcutaneous vehicle. Mice were weighed daily to monitor morbidity. A
subset (n = 4) of each cohort was randomly assigned for pulmonary function
measurements by whole-body plethysmography (WBP, Data Sciences
International) daily28. On 2 dpi, three animals per group were killed by isoﬂuorane
overdose, lungs were scored for hemorrhage (described above), and the large left
lobe was frozen at −80 °C for viral titration via plaque assay as described above22.
On 6 dpi, animals were killed and processed as done on 2 dpi.
The second prophylactic study was designed to optimize the potential effects
IFNb based on the PK/PD studies described above. Given that interferon
stimulated gene expression peaks between 2 and 4 h post administration, in this
study all groups receiving IFNb treatments were started on treatment 2 h prior to
infection and every other day thereafter. Moreover, to maximize the potential IFN
effect in the IFNb only group, we utilized a 25× human equivalent dose rather than
utilize a 1× human equivalent dose as done in the previous prophylactic study. In
randomly assigned groups of 12–14-week-old Ces1c−/− hDPP4 female mice, we
compared vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb low (1.6 MIU/kg or 4.8E4 IU/30 g mouse
(40 µg/30 g mouse)), LPV/RTV-IFNb high (40 MIU/kg or 1.2 MIU/30 g mouse
(1000 µg/30 g mouse)), and IFNb high alone. The LPV/RTV dose amounts and
schedule were similar to that in the previous study. To control for dosing effects,
vehicle-treated mice received both oral vehicle and subcutaneous PBS to mirror
IFNb injections. Likewise, IFNb only group received oral vehicle to mirror that seen
in orally dosed groups. Similar to the previous study, RDV and its vehicle were
administered as a control. MERS-CoV infection was performed exactly as
described in the previous study. Mice were weighed daily to monitor morbidity.
Unlike previous studies, pulmonary function measurements by WBP (Data
Sciences International) were performed on all mice in all groups until 2 dpi, after
which these measurements were performed on all remaining mice per group (n =
6)28. On 2 dpi, three animals per group were killed by isoﬂuorane overdose, lungs
were scored for hemorrhage (described above), and the large left lobe was frozen at
−80 °C for viral titration via plaque assay22. On 6 dpi, animals were killed and
processed as done on 2 dpi.

Therapeutic in vivo efﬁcacy studies. For head-to-head therapeutic efﬁcacy studies
comparing RDV to LPV/RTV-IFNb, female 9–12-week-old Ces1c−/− hDPP4 were
randomly assigned to each treatment group (n = 10–12). After a 5–7 day acclimation
time at BSL3, mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and then
intranasally infected with 5E + 04 pfu of MERS M35C4 in 50 µl virus collection
medium (see above). One day post infection, treatment was initiated. For LPV/RTV
groups, mice were administered a human equivalent dose of a coformulation of LPV
(160 mg/kg) and RTV (40 mg/kg) at 5 mL/kg once daily via oral gavage. Animals that
received LPV/RTV also received mouse IFNb (R + D Systems) every other day at one
of two doses via subcutaneous injection. The high IFNb dose group was administered
a 25× human equivalent dose of 40 MIU/kg or 1.2 MIU/30 g mouse (1000 µg/30 g
mouse). The low IFNb dose group was administered as 1× human equivalent dose of
1.6 MIU/kg or 4.8E4 IU/30 g mouse (40 µg/30 g mouse). To control for potential
vehicle effects in the LPV/RTV-IFNb groups, we administered oral vehicle (propylene
glycol, ethanol) daily and subcutaneously injected with PBS every other day. RDV
(25 mg/kg) at 10 mL/kg was administered twice daily via subcutaneous injection. As a
control for RDV, an additional group was given subcutaneous vehicle as a control. To
monitor morbidity, mice were weighed daily. A subset of each cohort was randomly
assigned for pulmonary function measurements by WBP (Data Sciences
12

International) daily28. On 6 dpi, animals were killed by isoﬂurane overdose, lungs
were scored for hemorrhage (described above), and the large left lobe was frozen at
−80 °C for viral titration via plaque assay as described above22. The inferior right lobe
was placed in 10% buffered formalin and stored at 4 °C for 1–3 weeks, until sectioning
and histological analysis. Lung sectioning, hematoxylin and eosin staining, as well as
MERS-CoV antigen staining as described above were performed by the Animal
Histopathology & Laboratory Medicine Core at UNC.
Acute lung injury histological assessment tools. We used two different and
complementary quantitative histologic tools to determine if antiviral treatments
diminished the histopathologic features associated with lung injury. Both analyses
and scoring were performed by a Board Certiﬁed Veterinary Pathologist who was
blinded to the treatment groups.
The ﬁrst tool is a Lung Injury Scoring System that was created by the American
Thoracic Society in order to help quantitate histological features of ALI observed in
mouse models and increase their translation to the human condition26. In a
blinded manner, we chose three random diseased ﬁelds of lung tissue at high power
(60 ×), which were scored for the following: (A) neutrophils in the alveolar space
(none = 0, 1–5 cells = 1, > 5 cells = 2), (B) neutrophils in the interstitial space/
septae (none = 0, 1–5 cells = 1, > 5 cells = 2), (C) hyaline membranes (none = 0,
one membrane = 1, > 1 membrane = 2), (D) Proteinaceous debris in air spaces
(none = 0, one instance = 1, > 1 instance = 2), (E) alveolar septal thickening (< 2×
mock thickness = 0, 2–4× mock thickness = 1, > 4× mock thickness = 2). To
obtain a lung injury score per ﬁeld, the scores for A–E were then put into the
following formula, which contains multipliers that assign varying levels of
importance for each phenotype of the disease state.: score = [(20x A) + (14 x B) +
(7 x C) + (7 x D) + (2 x E)]/100. The scores for the three ﬁelds per mouse were
averaged to obtain a ﬁnal score ranging from 0 to and including 1.
The second histological tool to quantitate lung injury was reported by Schmidt
et al., where they used this tool to quantitate diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in mice
infected with RSV29. DAD is the pathological hallmark of ALI26,29,46. Similar to the
implementation of the ATS tool described above, we scored three random diseased
ﬁelds of lung tissue at high power (60 × ) for the following in a blinded manner: 1 =
absence of cellular sloughing and necrosis, 2 = Uncommon solitary cell sloughing and
necrosis (1–2 foci/ﬁeld), 3 = multifocal (3 + foci) cellular sloughing and necrosis with
uncommon septal wall hyalinization, or 4 = multifocal ( >75% of ﬁeld) cellular
sloughing and necrosis with common and/or prominent hyaline membranes. The
scores for the three ﬁelds per mouse were averaged to get a ﬁnal DAD score
per mouse.
Cleaved caspase-3 antigen quantitation. The active and cleaved form of caspase3 can be differentiated by immunohistochemistry. Lung tissue sections were stained
for cleaved caspase-3 antigen (1:500, Cell Signaling #9664) by the Animal Histopathology & Laboratory Medicine Core at UNC. At the UNC Translational
Pathology Laboratory (TPL) Core, stained slides were scanned on an Aperio
ScanScope XT (Leica Biosystems) with a 20X power objective and a camera
resolution of 0.4942 microns per pixel. Images were analyzed in Deﬁniens Architect
XD 2.7 with Tissue Studio version 4.4.2. Within each tissue section, total area was
calculated. Single cells were detected initially based on hematoxylin staining of
nuclei, and cell borders were interpolated in Tissue Studio. Each cell was then
scored for cleaved caspase staining intensity based on a linear scale of Low,
Medium, and High scale. The sum of the percent positive for high and medium
caspase-3 staining was graphed for our studies. Tissue sections of diseased mouse
intestine was used as a positive control.
Statistical analysis. All statistical data analyses were performed in Graphpad
Prism 7. Statistical signiﬁcance for each endpoint was determined with speciﬁc
statistical tests. For each test, a P-value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Speciﬁc
tests to determine statistical signiﬁcance are noted in each sure legend.
