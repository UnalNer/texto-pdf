Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as
the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have
been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide. Despite
the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has
declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The
COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates,
children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial
infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with
pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely
to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and
disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including
remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control
intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread
throughout the country within 1 month. The pathogen of
this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name on February 11,
2020 for the epidemic disease: Corona Virus Disease
(COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has affected people in more
than 28 countries/regions, including Taiwan, and has
become a global threat.1e4 In addition, the Coronavirus
Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses has renamed the virus, which was provisionally
named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy,
and established practice.5 Prior to this, on January 30,
2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth
public health emergency of international concern; therefore, this outbreak constitutes a public health risk through
the international spread of disease and requires a coordinated international response. Increased dissemination of
information through use of the internet is associated with
increased transmission of information from all geographical
regions and across disciplines regarding recognition of
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-196; nevertheless, important factors
associated with COVID-19, specifically age and sex distribution, incubation period, clinical features, and optimal
treatment, remain uncertain. Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological
characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19,
including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory
disease (ARD), and pneumonia.

Several reports suggest the following as potential drug
candidates, although the clinical effectiveness of these
drugs have not yet been evidenced for COVID-19: lopinavir/
ritonavir (Kaletra), nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase
inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (arbidol), DNA synthesis
inhibitors (such as tenofovir disoproxil, and lamivudine),
chloroquine, ACE2-based peptides, 3C-like protease
(3CLpro) inhibitors, novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor,
teicoplanin, and Chinese traditional medicine (such as
ShuFengJieDu or Lianhuaqingwen capsules).30e39 The
effectiveness of remdesivir is more evident in the literature
to date; indeed, it appears to be the most promising drug
for COVID-19. In fact, an in vitro study demonstrated that
the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of remdesivir against
nCoV-2019/BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 in Vero E6 cells
was 0.77 mM, and the 90% effective concentration (EC90)
was 1.76 mM.31 However, only one case in the US showed a
clinical response to remdesivir, although the viral load
appeared to decline at the time of initiating remdesivir
(cycle threshold from 18e20 to 23e24)
