The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness in humans,
and no vaccines or specific treatments are available. Infections are initiated via binding of the MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein to sialosides and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (the attachment and entry receptors, respectively). To understand MERS-CoV
engagement of sialylated receptors, we determined the cryo-EM structures of S in complex with 5-N-acetyl neuraminic acid,
5-N-glycolyl neuraminic acid, sialyl-LewisX, α2,3-sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine and α2,6-sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine at 2.7–3.0 Å
resolution. We show that recognition occurs via a conserved groove that is essential for MERS-CoV S-mediated attachment to
sialosides and entry into human airway epithelial cells. Our data illuminate MERS-CoV S sialoside specificity and suggest that
selectivity for α2,3-linked over α2,6-linked receptors results from enhanced interactions with the former class of oligosaccharides. This study provides a structural framework explaining MERS-CoV attachment to sialoside receptors and identifies a site
of potential vulnerability to inhibitors of viral entry.

T

he Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) was discovered in 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula as
the causative agent of acute respiratory distress (and renal
failure), with an unusually high fatality rate of ~35% (ref. 1). The
vast majority of the 2,482 confirmed cases were reported in the
Middle East, although the virus was introduced into 27 countries.
A total of 203 new MERS-CoV cases were reported in 2019 and
there is currently no vaccine or cure for MERS or any coronavirusinduced diseases in humans. Zoonotic MERS-CoV transmission
from dromedary camels (the host reservoir for this virus) along
with human-to-human transmission are the two known modes of
infection2,3. Future emergence of (zoonotic) coronaviruses is likely
to occur, given the large reservoir in bats and birds, underscoring
the importance of studying these pathogens4–7.
MERS-CoV is an enveloped Nidovirus decorated with homotrimers of the spike (S) glycoprotein that mediates entry into host
cells. S is the major antigen present at the viral surface and is the
target of neutralizing antibodies during infection as well as the
focus of vaccine design. Recent cryo-EM structures of MERS-CoV
and related coronavirus S ectodomain trimers provided snapshots
of this key protein in prefusion8–15 and postfusion16 conformations,
receptor-bound states17–19 and in complex with neutralizing antibodies20,21. MERS-CoV S is composed of an N-terminal S1 subunit,
which is folded as four domains (A–D) and mediates attachment to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4, the host receptor)22, and
a C-terminal S2 subunit that merges the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection. MERS-CoV S is cleaved at the junction
between the S1 and S2 subunits either during viral biogenesis or
upon encounter of target cells23–26. A second cleavage site, designated S2′, is found upstream of the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit
and is processed at the onset of membrane fusion. Both cleavage
sites participate in enhancing viral entry and modulating host
range and cell tropism23,24,27.

Sialic acids (derivatives of neuraminic acid) are ubiquitous carbohydrates found as terminal residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids decorating the surface of eukaryotic cells. Neuraminic acid
modifications, along with the formation of specific glycosidic linkages, result in a wide chemical variety of sialoglycoconjugates across
cell types, tissues and animal species28. As a result, differential sialoside recognition can profoundly impact the zoonotic transmission,
tropism and virulence of many viruses. For example, a few amino
acid substitutions in influenza virus hemagglutinins account for
the preference switch from avian enteric tract to human respiratory
tract sialylated receptors29–31.
MERS-CoV primarily infects human lung epithelial cells upon
interacting with DPP4 (ref. 22). Crystal structures of the MERS-CoV
S domain B in complex with the DPP4 ectodomain32,33, along with
cryo-EM structures of the MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer15,20,21,
have furthered our understanding of the mechanism of DPP4
engagement. In addition to attachment to DPP4, we recently showed
that MERS-CoV infection of human airway epithelial cells involves
low-affinity interactions with sialosides, using the S glycoprotein
domain A, as depletion of sialic acid from the cell surface dampened viral entry34. A binding preference was found for α2,3-linked
over α2,6-linked sialosides, and these interactions were hindered by
9-O-acetylation or 5-N-glycolylation of the terminal neuraminic
acid34. Furthermore, we found that MERS-CoV S sialylated receptors are abundant in the camel nasal respiratory epithelium and the
human lung alveoli, which coincides with DPP4 expression and the
sites of MERS-CoV replication in these mammals34,35. As sialoside
modifications, linkages and distribution vary among and within
host species, the selectivity of MERS-CoV S for certain sialoside glycotopes may provide a determinant of host and tissue tropism of this
zoonotic pathogen. These findings provided a plausible rationale
for explaining that equine DPP4 could support MERS-CoV infection of cultured cells, although horses were found to be resistant

to experimental MERS-CoV infection (despite the presence of
DPP4 in their respiratory tract)36–38. Although sialoside attachment
appears to be a key step modulating MERS-CoV infection, the location of the sialoside-binding site, the interactions involved in ligand
recognition and the molecular basis for receptor specificity remain
unknown. This information is crucial for understanding viral tropism and infectivity, assessing the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV
and related coronaviruses, and providing a blueprint for the design
of coronavirus inhibitors.
To understand the structural basis of MERS-CoV attachment to
and specificity for host sialosides, we determined cryo-EM structures of the S glycoprotein ectodomain trimer in complex with
5-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), 5-N-glycolyl neuraminic acid
(Neu5Gc), sialyl-LewisX (sLeX), α2,3-sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine
(2,3-SLN) and α2,6-sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine (2,6-SLN) at 2.7,
3.0, 2.7, 2.7 and 2.9 Å resolution, respectively. We demonstrate that
the receptor binds in a groove located at the surface of domain A
that is distinct from the 9-O-acetyl sialoside-engagement site identified for HCoV-OC43 and related β-1 coronavirus S glycoproteins19,39. We further show that the residues involved in Neu5Ac
recognition are conserved across MERS-CoV isolates and essential
for MERS-CoV S-mediated hemagglutination of human erythrocytes and entry into human airway epithelial cells. Our data rationalize MERS-CoV S attachment to neuraminic acids that are not
9-O-acetylated or 5-N-glycolylated and suggest an explanation for
the selectivity for α2,3-linked over α2,6-linked sialosides. This study
provides a structural framework for understanding MERS-CoV S
sialoglycan receptor engagement and specificity, illuminates host
range and cell tropism, and identifies a site of vulnerability accessible to neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors.

Results

A sialoside-binding site in the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. To
identify the MERS-CoV S sialoside-recognition site, we determined
a cryo-EM structure of the MERS-CoV S 2P stabilized ectodomain
trimer21 incubated with 100 mM Neu5Ac at 2.7 Å resolution (Fig.
1a, Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a–g and Table 1). The presence of
the sialoside stabilized a large fraction of MERS-CoV S trimers in
the closed state, with all three DPP4-binding B domains adopting
a down conformation, obeying three-fold symmetry. We did not
detect major conformational changes compared to closed protomers
of the LCA60 Fab-bound MERS-CoV S structure20 (Cα r.m.s. deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.35 Å for 1,145 aligned residues). The resolution
estimate of our map is supported by the detection of ordered water
molecules40 interacting with the S glycoprotein (Extended Data
Fig. 1f,g) and by the observation of folic acid bound to S, as previously identified using X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry
of isolated domain A21. The density is equally well resolved for the
ligand and the surrounding S amino acid residues, allowing unambiguous identification of the binding site and docking of Neu5Ac
in the map (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The ligand interacts with a
groove located at the periphery of domain A that is distinct from the
HCoV-OC43 S 9-O-acetyl sialoside-binding site19 (Figs. 1a–e and
2a–c). The absence of N-linked glycans in the immediate vicinity
of the binding groove probably facilitates unobstructed engagement
of sialoglycoconjugates at the surface of target cells (Fig. 2a). The
ligand-binding site is located ~50 and ~75 Å away from the DPP4binding site of a neighboring B domain in the closed or open state,
respectively (Fig. 1b).
The ligand C1 carboxylate electrostatically interacts with the
Ser133 side chain hydroxyl, and the 5-nitrogen atom is hydrogenbonded to the Ile132 backbone carbonyl (Fig. 1c–e). The Neu5Ac
hydroxyl group at position 8 is hydrogen-bonded to the Arg307 side
chain guanidium whereas the hydroxyl group at position 9 interacts
with the Arg307 guanidium as well as the Ala92 backbone amide
and carbonyl oxygen via hydrogen bonding (Fig. 1c–e). The ligand
1152

N-acetyl methyl inserts into a hydrophobic depression defined by
residues Phe39, Phe101, Ile131 and Ile132 whereas the N-acetyl carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to the Gln36 side chain amide
(Fig. 1c–e). The sialoside buries 280 Å2 of it surface upon MERSCoV S engagement, corresponding to 61% of the ligand total accessible surface area, with most interactions occurring on the same
side of the ligand. Bioinformatics analysis of MERS-CoV isolates
shows that the residues contacting the sialoside or participating
in the formation of the binding groove are conserved. Specifically,
Gln36, Phe39, Phe101, Ile132 and R307 are strictly conserved in the
284 MERS-CoV isolates sequenced so far. The H91Y substitution
is observed in four MERS-CoV isolates (human/Korea/Seoul/168–
1–2015 GB, ALB08311; human/Korea/Seoul/168-2-2015 GB,
ALB08322; human/KOR/Seoul/014-2015 GB, ANC28634.1; human/
Riyadh_1337/KSA/2014 GB, AMW90853.1), the S133N or S133R
substitutions are present in two isolates (human/England/4/2013
GB, AJD81440.1 and Hu/Quaseem-KSA-18012872/2018 GB,
QBF80608.1, respectively) and the Q304K substitution is observed
in 1 isolate (camel/UAE/D1164.11/2014 GB, AJG44080.1).
The architecture of the binding groove suggests 9-O-acetylation
of the neuraminic acid could not be sterically accommodated
(Extended Data Fig. 3a), in agreement with the previously reported
distinct specificity of MERS-CoV S compared to HCoV-OC43 S34.
To assess if 5-N-glycolylation of the neuraminic acid could be tolerated, we determined a cryo-EM structure of MERS-CoV S 2P
incubated with 100 mM Neu5Gc at 3.0 Å resolution (Extended Data
Figs. 1b, 3b–f and 4a–d and Table 1). Comparison of this map with
the MERS-CoV S/Neu5Ac map shows that the Neu5Gc density is
weaker than that of the Neu5Ac and the glycolyl hydroxyl group
could not be resolved, even after extensive focused 3D classification
of the data (Extended Data Fig. 3b–f). This observation is in line with
the reported MERS-CoV S binding preference to Neu5Ac compared
to Neu5Gc based on the lack of hemagglutination of (Neu5Gc-rich)
horse erythrocytes and absence of binding to Neu5Gc-containing
sialosides on a glycan array34. The structure suggests the MERSCoV S hydrophobic pocket defined by Phe39, Phe101, Ile131 and
Ile132 could sterically and/or chemically disfavor accommodation
of the 5-N-glycolyl hydroxyl group in the conformation observed
in virtually all Neu5Gc-containing protein complex structures
(Extended Data Fig. 3b–f). The high concentrations of sialosides
used for the cryo-EM experiments, however, allowed us to visualize
Neu5Gc bound to MERS-CoV S, much in the same way that crystal structures of influenza virus hemagglutinins in complex with
mismatched receptor analogs or of rhesus rotavirus VP8* bound to
Neu5Gc were obtained in spite of very weak or lack of detectable
interactions in solution29,30,41. Because the equine respiratory tract is
abundantly decorated with Neu5Gc-containing oligosaccharides42,
these data collectively suggest a plausible explanation for the resistance of horses to experimental MERS-CoV infection, despite the
fact MERS-CoV S can use equine DPP4 for promoting entry into
target cells in vitro34,36,38.
The sialoside binding site is required for S-mediated viral attachment and entry. To evaluate the importance of the interactions
identified by cryo-EM for sialoside recognition, we substituted with
alanine individual MERS-CoV S amino acid residues interacting
with Neu5Ac and assessed the effect on domain A-mediated hemagglutination of human erythrocytes. As previously described, the
wild-type MERS-CoV S domain A fused to human immunoglobulin Fc only promoted hemagglutination of human erythrocytes
when multimerized on lumazine synthase nanoparticles34, indicative of enhancement of low-affinity interactions via avidity (Fig. 3a
and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Complete inhibition of hemagglutination was observed, however, for each binding site mutant tested, that
is, F39A, H91A, I132A, S133A and R307A (Fig. 3a and Extended
Data Fig. 5a). These results validated the structural observations by

demonstrating that recognition of Neu5Ac via these residues is necessary for MERS-CoV S-mediated attachment to sialosides.
To further assess the functional relevance of the identified interactions, we interrogated the impact of individual domain A substitutions on MERS-CoV S-mediated entry into target cells. We used
the murine leukemia virus platform with a luciferase reporter43 for
quantifying entry of particles pseudotyped with either wild-type or
mutant MERS-CoV S into human airway Calu-3 cells. The S133A
and R307A substitutions abrogated entry of pseudotyped particles
due to disruption of the aforementioned electrostatic interactions
involving the Neu5Ac C1 carboxylate and glycerol side chain,
respectively (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). The F39A and
H91A mutants showed reduced infectivity of the pseudotyped particles by more than 90%, probably due to disruption of the ligandbinding groove and loss of favorable van der Waals or electrostatic
interactions (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). These findings
demonstrate the key role of the identified residues for interacting
with Neu5Ac in the context of a full-length, membrane-embedded
MERS-CoV S glycoprotein and show that attachment to sialoside

receptors using the binding site identified by cryo-EM is essential
for promoting MERS-CoV S-mediated entry into human airway
Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, as sialidase treatment of Calu-3 cells34
or mutations of the S sialoside-recognition site abrogated MERSCoV S-mediated entry, it is likely that sialoside attachment either
precedes DPP4 engagement or occurs simultaneously.
MERS-CoV S specificity for α2,3-linked sialoside receptors. We
previously showed that the MERS-CoV S domain A preferentially
interacts with α2,3-linked, compared to α2,6-linked, sialosides, with
sulfated sLeX being the preferred binder34. To understand the architectural principles underlying this specificity, we determined three
cryo-EM structures of MERS-CoV S 2P in the presence of 50 mM
sLeX (Extended Data Figs. 1c and 6 and Table 1), 70 mM 2,3-SLN
(Extended Data Figs. 1d and 7, and Table 1) or 70 mM 2,6-SLN
(Extended Data Figs. 1e and 8 and Table 1) at 2.7, 2.7 and 2.9 Å
resolution, respectively.
The cryo-EM reconstruction obtained for MERS-CoV S in complex with sLeX resolves the terminal Neu5Ac linked to galactose, via a

2,3-glycosidic bond adopting a cis configuration, as well as the N-acetyl
glucosamine (GlcNAc) and fucose rings at lower contour level due to
conformational heterogeneity of the ligand (Fig. 4a,b). Engagement of
the Neu5Ac moiety of the sLeX involves identical interactions to those
observed in our structure of MERS-CoV S in complex with Neu5Ac
(Fig. 1c–e). This finding, and the detection of a galactose moiety
linked to the oxygen at position 2 of Neu5Ac, validate our docking
of the ligand in the cryo-EM density. The sLeX trisaccharide core
(Neu5Ac(α2–3)galactose(β1–4)GlcNAc) adopts a roughly linear conformation when bound to MERS-CoV S (Fig. 4a,b), as is the case for
influenza virus hemagglutinins in complex with α2,3-sialosides29,31,44.
The MERS-CoV S structure in complex with 2,3-SLN shows a very
similar pose of the ligand to that observed for sLeX, although the
GlcNAc is even more conformationally heterogeneous in the trisaccharide compared to sLeX and was therefore not modeled (Fig. 4c,d).
1154

The cryo-EM map obtained for MERS-CoV S bound to 2,6-SLN
resolves the Neu5Ac and galactose moieties, linked via a 2,6-glycosidic bond adopting a cis configuration, and the GlcNAc ring at
lower contour level due to conformational variability of the ligand
(Fig. 4e,f). The 2,6-SLN has a U-shaped conformation, comparable
to reports on influenza virus hemagglutinins29,30, that positions the
GlcNAc moiety away from the binding groove and the rest of the
S glycoprotein (Fig. 4e,f).
The cryo-EM structures suggest an explanation for the finding
that sulfated sLeX is the preferred MERS-CoV S sialoside ligand34.
Although the sLeX conformational dynamic limited its resolvability, the galactose and the GlcNAc moieties appear to be positioned within contact distance of the MERS-CoV S domain A due
to the ligand conformation (Fig. 4a–d,g,h). Furthermore, sulfation
of the GlcNAc hydroxyl group at position 6 could putatively allow

hindering contacts with S (which appear limited to the Neu5Ac
and galactose moieties). We therefore hypothesize that the trend
of preferential attachment to α2,3- over α2,6-sialosides results
from enhanced interactions with the former type of ligand, leading
MERS-CoV to target cell types presenting such sialylated receptors
at their surface.

Discussion

We show here that sialosides bind to MERS-CoV S using a site distinct from the one observed for HCoV-OC43 S in complex with
9-O-acetyl sialylated receptors19,39, despite the fact that the bound
ligands are only separated by a few ångstroms from each other when
superimposing the two structures. Although the β-sandwich architecture of domain A is conserved among all coronaviruses, distinct
variable loops are grafted onto it, and neither the MERS-CoV S nor
the HCoV-OC43 S sialoside-binding site is conserved in the infectious bronchitis virus S glycoprotein10, which is known to engage
α2,3-sialosides at the surface of avian host cells45. These findings
suggest coronavirus S glycoproteins have independently evolved
the ability to recognize sialosides using domain A, similar to their
ability to engage different proteinaceous receptors via modifications
of domain B. Our results therefore set coronavirus S glycoproteins
apart from influenza virus A hemagglutinins, which recognize
the Neu5Ac moiety through a largely conserved binding site29,30.

Fig. 4 | Structural basis of MERS-CoV S selectivity for α2,3-linked sialoside receptors. a–f, Enlarged views of the MERS-CoV S structures in complex
with sLeX (a,b), 2,3-SLN (c,d) and 2,6-SLN (e,f). The cryo-EM densities corresponding to the ligands are shown as a blue mesh contoured at 3.7σ (a),
3.2σ (b), 5.8σ (c,d) and 4.5σ (e,f). g,h, The ligand-binding site with the sLeX and 2,6-SLN-bound MERS-CoV S structures superimposed, showing the

We hypothesize that coronaviruses that utilize both an entry receptor and an attachment receptor for infection, such as MERS-CoV or
transmissible gastroenteritis virus, have more evolutionary freedom
with respect to their ability to attach to sialoglycans than viruses
only using an entry receptor. This could have led to the independent
loss and/or acquisition of a sialoside-recognition function as an
adaption to new hosts upon cross-species transmission of distinct
viruses. The ability to interact with sialoglycoconjugates might be a
recent MERS-CoV S acquisition, as neither HKU4 S1 nor HKU5 S1
could hemagglutinate human erythrocytes34. This modular evolutionary plasticity underlies coronavirus cross-species transmission,
switching of host cell types and viral fitness.
We previously suggested that MERS-CoV S interacts with sialoside receptors through lower-affinity interactions than influenza
A/California/04/2009 hemagglutinin (containing the T200A and
E227A substitutions), as multimerization with a lumazine synthase
nanoparticle was required to detect binding of a dimeric MERSCoV S domain A-Fc construct but not of a dimeric hemagglutinin
ectodomain-Fc construct34. Because influenza A virus utilizes neuraminidase to promote the release of progeny virions from host cells,
off-target cells or decoys, the enhanced affinity for sialosides is balanced with a receptor-destroying enzyme. Similarly, HCoV-OC43
possesses a hemagglutinin esterase with receptor-destroying activity46 to achieve the same function. Because MERS-CoV does not
encode an equivalent enzyme, the binding dynamic of viral particles
to sialoside receptors is entirely based on the energetics of these
reversible interactions34. The strong dependence on interactions
1156

with sialosides for MERS-CoV entry into human airway Calu-3
cells is therefore probably a result of the high concentration of
sialylated receptors34, favoring virus adsorption through avidity and
potentially increasing the likelihood of binding to DPP4, leading to
viral entry. Similar roles have been proposed for carcinoembryonic
antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (ref. 47) and binding immunoglobulin protein48.
Although MERS-CoV S is densely decorated with N-linked
glycans, the sialoside-recognition site is unobstructed, a possible
requirement for receptor engagement. This finding is in marked
contrast with the conformational masking and/or glycan shielding
of the domain B entry receptor-binding motifs observed for several coronavirus S glycoproteins, including MERS-CoV S13,15,18,20,21.
We recently identified an antibody-blocking domain A-mediated
hemagglutination of erythrocytes with in vitro neutralizing activity of MERS-CoV S pseudovirions and partial in vivo prophylactic
protection of mice challenged with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV49.
These findings, along with our mutagenesis data, indicate that the
sialoside-binding groove identified here represents a key site of vulnerability to inhibitors of MERS-CoV infection that could be targeted for the future development of therapeutics.

Methods

Cell lines. HEK293F is a cell line adapted to grow in suspension (Life
Technologies). HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC, catalog no. CRL-11268) and human
hepatic Huh-7 cells (National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health
and Nutrition, catalog no. JCRB0403) are adherent cells. Cell lines were not
authenticated or tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Protein expression and purification. The MERS-CoV S 2P ectodomain was
produced in 500 ml HEK293F cells grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293
expression medium (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified 8% (vol/vol) CO2
incubator rotating at 130 r.p.m. The cultures were transfected using 293fectin
(ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a density of one million cells per
ml and cultivated for three days. The supernatants were harvested and cells
resuspended for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarified supernatants
were purified using a 5 ml Cobalt affinity column (Takara). Purified protein was
concentrated and flash-frozen in Tris-saline (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl)
before cryo-EM analysis.
Protein A-fused lumazine synthase nanoparticles (a self-assembling 60-meric
lumazine synthase nanoparticle, N-terminally extended with the immunoglobulin
Fc-binding domain of the Staphylococcus aureus protein A) and Fc-tagged domain
A (residues 19–357) or Fc-tagged domain B (residues 358–588) of the MERSCoV S protein (GB, YP_009047204.1) were expressed and purified as previously
described34. Purified proteins were analyzed on a 12% (wt/vol) SDS–PAGE
gel under reducing conditions and stained with GelCodeBlue stain reagent
(Thermo Scientific).
Cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation and data collection. Incubation
of 1 μM MERS-CoV S 2P stabilized ectodomain trimer with 100 mM Neu5Ac
(Millipore 110138), 100 mM Neu5Gc (Miilipore 362000), 50 mM sLeX
(Carbosynth OS04058), 70 mM 2,3-SLN (Carbosynth OS06484) or 70 mM
2,6-SLN (Carbosynth OS09313) was performed overnight at 4 °C. We used
100 mM Neu5Ac based on our previous work on HCoV-OC43 S19 and work on
influenza virus30, whereas the lower concentrations used for larger ligands were
determined empirically based on the contrast of cryo-EM micrographs. A 3 μl
volume of 0.16 mg ml−1 MERS S-sialoglycan complex was loaded onto a freshly
glow discharged (30 s at 20 mA) lacey carbon grid with a thin layer of evaporated
continuous carbon before plunge freezing using a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher
Scientific) using a blot force of −1 and 2.5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 25 °C.
Data were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope
operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector and
Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width
of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon50 at a nominal
magnification of ×130,000 and a pixel size of 0.525 Å. The dose rate was adjusted
to 8 counts per pixel per second, and each video was acquired in super-resolution
mode fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms.
Cryo-electron microscopy data processing. Video frame alignment, estimation
of the microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking and
extraction were carried out using Warp51. Particle images were extracted with a
box size of 800 binned to 400 yielding a pixel size of 1.05 Å. For each dataset, two
rounds of reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification were performed
using Relion52 to select well-defined particle images. Subsequently, two rounds of
3D classification with 50 iterations each (angular sampling of 7.5° for 25 iterations
and 1.8° with local search for 25 iterations) were carried out using Relion without
imposing symmetry to select closed trimers with the three B domains in the down
conformation. 3D refinements imposing C3 symmetry were carried out using nonuniform refinement in cryoSPARC53 using an initial model generated by converting
a modified version of PDB 6NB3 (ref. 20) with all three B domains closed to a map
low-pass filtered to 30 Å resolution. Particle images were subjected to the Bayesian
polishing procedure implemented in Relion3.0 (ref. 54) before performing another
round of 3D refinement in Relion followed by per-particle defocus refinement
and, again, 3D refinement in Relion. The particles were then subjected to 3D
classification without refining angles and shifts using a soft mask delineating the
ligand-binding site and with a tau value of 60. Final 3D refinements were carried
out using non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC. Local resolution estimation,
filtering and sharpening were carried out using cryoSPARC. Reported resolutions
are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion
and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking
by high-resolution noise substitution55.
Model building. We used UCSF Chimera56 to fit the MERS-CoV S atomic model
(PDB 6NB3) into the cryo-EM map followed by subsequent manually rebuilding
using Coot57,58. N-linked glycans were hand-built into the density where visible,
and then refined and relaxed using Rosetta59–64. Glycan refinement relied on a
dedicated Rosetta protocol, which uses physically realistic geometries based on
prior knowledge of saccharide chemical properties62, and was aided by using
both sharpened and unsharpened maps. The final models were analyzed using
MolProbity65, EMRinger66, Privateer67 and PISA68. Figures were generated using
UCSF ChimeraX69.

Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
Pseudovirus entry assay. Murine leukemia virus pseudotyped with
MERS-CoV S was prepared as previously described43. HEK293T/17 cells
were co-transfected with a full-length MERS-CoV S or MERS-CoV S mutant
encoding plasmid, a murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol packaging construct
and the murine leukemia virus transfer vector encoding a luciferase reporter
using the Lipofectamine 2000 or 3000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 5–12 h
at 37 °C and 8% CO2 with transfection medium. Cells were then washed
with DMEM twice and DMEM containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS was added for
72 h. The supernatants were then harvested and filtered through 0.45 μm
membranes before concentration with a 30 kDa centrifugal concentrator
membrane (Amicon).
Calu-3 cells grown in DMEM containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol)
PenStrep were plated into 96-well plates following trypsinization at a density of
~3.2 × 104 cells per ml and allowed to grow for 48 h at 37 °C with 8% (vol/vol) CO2.
The cells were washed three times with DMEM before addition of 40 μl of MERSCoV S or MERS-CoV S mutant pseudovirus for 2 h at 37 °C with 8% (vol/vol) CO2.
Following the 2 h incubation, 40 μl of 20% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) PenStrep
was added to the wells and the plate was incubated for 72 h. ONE-Glo-EX was
added in equivolume (~75 μl to account for evaporation) and the luciferase counts
were read on a Varioskan plate reader.
Western blotting. SDS–PAGE (4×) loading buffer was added to all concentrated
pseudovirus samples. The samples were run on a 4–15% (wt/vol) gradient Trisglycine gel (BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membranes. An anti-S2 MERSCoV S purified 1.6c7 primary antibody49 (1:500 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor
680-conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody (1:40,000 dilution, Jackson
Laboratory) were used for western blotting. A LI-COR processor was used to
develop images.
Hemagglutination assay. High-sensitivity nanoparticle-based hemagglutination
assays were performed as previously described34. Briefly, wild-type or mutant
MERS-CoV S domain A-Fc (starting at 6.77 μg per well) was complexed with
protein A-fused lumazine synthase nanoparticles at a 0.6:1 molar ratio for 30 min
on ice. Mixtures were subsequently serially diluted (twofold dilutions) and mixed
1:1 with human erythrocytes (0.5% (wt/vol) in phosphate buffered saline) in
V-bottomed, 96-well plates. Hemagglutination was scored after 2 h of incubation
at 4 °C.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Structural basis for the MERS-CoV S selectivity for neuraminic acids that are not 9-O-acetylated or 5-N-glycolylated.
a, Superimposition of the 5-N-acetyl,9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid α-methyl glycoside (9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac, green) from the HCoV-OC43 S holo structure
(PDB 6NZK19) to the bound Neu5Ac from the MERS-CoV S/Neu5Ac complex structure suggests the MERS-CoV S sialoside-binding site could not
sterically accommodate the 9-O-acetyl group in this conformation. The distances between the 9-O-acetyl group and His91 or Ala92 are indicated.
b, The MERS-CoV S sialoside-binding site rendered as a ribbon diagram with the side chains of key surrounding residues shown. Neu5Ac is rendered with
the corresponding region of cryoEM density from the MERS-CoV S/Neu5Ac complex structure (low-pass filtered to 3Å and scaled to the MERS-CoV S/
Neu5Gc map) shown as a blue mesh contoured at 6σ. c–f, The cryoEM structure of MERS-CoV S in complex with Neu5Gc shows weaker density for the
sialoside (blue mesh contoured at 6σ), indicating poor steric and/or chemical accommodation of the 5-N-glycolyl hydroxyl group in the hydrophobic
pocket defined by Phe39, Phe101, Ile131 and Ile132. In panels (c-e) Neu5Gc was modeled based on the porcine rotavirus CRW-8 VP8* holo structure (PDB
3TAY41) which corresponds to the conformation observed in 1 out of 8 structures available in the protein data bank with a Neu5Gc analogue. In panel
f, Neu5Gc was modeled based on the rhesus rotavirus VP8* holo structure (PDB 3TB041) which is the only structure in the protein data bank featuring
Neu5Gc with the 5-N-glycolyl group in an alternate orientation. The distance between the 5-N-glycolyl hydroxyl group and Gln36 is indicated.
