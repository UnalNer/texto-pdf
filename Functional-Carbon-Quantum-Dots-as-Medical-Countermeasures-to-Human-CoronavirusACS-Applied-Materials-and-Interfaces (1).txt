ABSTRACT: Therapeutic options for the highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections are urgently needed. Anticoronavirus therapy is
however challenging, as coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly
mutating. In this work, the antiviral activity of seven diﬀerent carbon
quantum dots (CQDs) for the treatment of human coronavirus HCoV229E infections was investigated. The ﬁrst generation of antiviral CQDs
was derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric
acid as carbon precursors and postmodiﬁed with boronic acid ligands.
These nanostructures showed a concentration-dependent virus inactivation with an estimated EC50 of 52 ± 8 μg mL−1. CQDs derived from
4-aminophenylboronic acid without any further modiﬁcation resulted in
the second-generation of anti-HCoV nanomaterials with an EC50 lowered
to 5.2 ± 0.7 μg mL−1. The underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs
was revealed to be inhibition of HCoV-229E entry that could be due to
interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with HCoV-229E entry receptors; surprisingly, an equally large inhibition
activity was observed at the viral replication step.

pandemic. Therefore, therapeutic options are urgently needed.
The current treatments for MERS-CoV are extrapolated from
SARS-CoV and H1N1 inﬂuenza outbreaks.5−7 These include
diﬀerent combinations of small molecules with broad antiviral
activity (e.g., ribavirin, corticosteroids, and interferons (IFN)),
and monoclonal and polyclonal antibody therapies.7,8 The
membrane-anchored glycoprotein S has lately been found to be
essential for the interaction between the MERS-CoV and the
host cell,8,9 and the development of MERS-CoV entry/fusion
inhibitors targeting the S1 subunit is nowadays considered as a
viable antiviral strategy.
Recently, nanoscale materials have emerged as promising and
eﬃcient platforms to modulate the viral infection cycle.10 Given

1. INTRODUCTION
The eradication of viral infections is an ongoing challenge in the
medical ﬁeld, not only due to the problem of spreading but also
to the virus’ ability to escape therapy by genetic mutations. The
lack of targeted antiviral therapeutics as well as the constant
emergence of new viruses make the search for antiviral agents a
challenging and extremely needed research task.1 As part of a
global strategy to prevent epidemics, some severe emerging
pathogens with great epidemic potential have been identiﬁed by
the World Health Organization (WHO),2 including, next to
Ebola virus disease, the highly pathogenic human coronavirus
(HCoV) infections. While circulating HCoVs (HCoV-229E,
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1) cause relatively mild
common cold-like respiratory tract infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) lead to pneumonia requiring hospitalization and intensive care.3 A total of 2266
laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 804 associated deaths, have been declared to the WHO until now, with a

coronavirus HCoV-229E infections, boronic acid functional
groups were chemically integrated onto CQDs-1 formed
through hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric
acid (Figure 2A). The approach consists of sealing the organic
precursors in a Teﬂon-lined autoclave chamber and performing
the formation of CQDs at elevated temperature under reduced
pressure for 5 h. The pH value of the resulting CQDs
suspensions was found to be 7.2 ± 0.2 (n = 5). To remove
larger precipitates, the as-obtained CQDs suspension was ﬁrst
centrifuged and then dialyzed against water for 24 h with a ﬁnal
yield of CQDs of 40%. CQDs-1 exhibit a spherical shape with an
average diameter of 4.5 ± 0.2 nm (Figure 2B). XPS analysis
(Table 1) indicates the presence of C, O, and N. The C1s highresolution XPS spectrum of CQDs-1 depicts three diﬀerent
carbon features: the graphitic CC at 283.4 eV, 284.9 eV (C−H),
and 286.4 eV (C−O, C−N) (Figure 2C). Analysis of the N1s
high-resolution XPS shows the presence surface NH2 groups
(399.9 eV) (Figure 2D). The Raman spectrum of the CQD-1
(Figure 2E) displays the characteristic G band at 1570 cm−1
related to in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon, and the D band at
1350 cm−1 attributed to disorder and defects. The ratio of the
intensity of these bands (ID/IG), used to express the extent of
sp2/sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms,17 is found to be 0.93 ±
0.15 for all particles.18 XRD patterns indicate their crystalline
nature (see Figure S1A) with a broad diﬀraction peak centered
at 25.5° corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0.35 nm. This
is larger than the spacing between (100) planes in bulk graphite
(0.23 nm) due to the incorporation of functional groups along
the edges of the CQDs.19 The UV−vis of CQDs-1 (see Figure S1B)
reveals an absorption maximum at ∼242 nm attributed to π−π*
transition of CC and a band at 344 nm due to n−π* transition
of CO and CN bonds.20,21 The ﬂuorescence quantum yield
(QY) is 0.33 as compared to that of quinine sulfate used as
reference (QY, 0.54 in 0.12 M H2SO4) (see Figure S1C).
A wavelength-dependent ﬂuorescence emission is observed (see
Figure S1D) where upon increasing the excitation wavelength,
the emission gradually shifts to the red region with an increase in
ﬂuorescence intensity. The phenomenon of excitation-dependent emission is typical for such nanostructures.5−7 The zeta
potential and hydrodynamic size of the CQDs-1 are summarized
in Table 1.
Functionalization of CQDs-1. The formation of CQDs-3
is based on a two-step chemical process. In a ﬁrst step,

that attachment of viruses into host cells is favored by multivalent interactions, the multivalent character of nanostructures
with their high surface to volume ratio, allowing the attachment
of several ligands, makes them well adapted to interfere with viral
attachment and blocking viral entry into cells.
In this work, we investigate the potential of functional carbon
quantum dots (CQDs) as inhibitors of host cells infection by
HCoV-229E coronavirus (Figure 1). CQDs with an average
diameter below 10 nm and excellent water dispersion are highly
attractive for nanomedical applications due to a lack of visible
signs of toxicity in animals.11 They can be synthesized quickly via
several diﬀerent inexpensive and simple methods, and their
excellent optical properties oﬀer in vivo tracking possibilities.
It was recently demonstrated that CQDs are suitable scaﬀolds to
interfere with the entry of viruses into cells.12−14 Boronic acidmodiﬁed CQDs were able to inhibit, for example, HIV-1 entry
by suppressing syncytium formation.13 Some of us have shown
lately the potential of CQDs-functionalized with boronic acid
and amine moieties to interfere with the entry of herpes simplex
virus type 1.12 Han and co-workers reported the potential
of CQDs as viral inhibitors by activation of type I interferon
responses.14
This unique study reveals that boronic acid functions can be
responsible for the anti-HCoV activity. CQDs derived from
citric acid/ethylenediamine and further conjugated by “click”
chemistry with boronic acid functions display an eﬀective 50%
inhibition concentration EC50 = 52 ± 8 μg mL−1. Likewise, CQDs
derived from 4-aminophenylboronic acid and phenylboronic acid
without any further modiﬁcation exhibit antiviral behavior with a
decreased eﬀective EC50 down to 5.2 ± 0.7 μg mL−1. The
underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs was revealed to
be the CQDs interaction with the HCoV-229E S protein.
Surprisingly, an equally large inhibition activity was observed at
the viral replication step.

a

azide band at 405.2 eV in the relevant spectra of CQDs-3 and
CQDs-4 (Figure 2F). The band at 399.2 eV (−NH2) is most
likely resulting from partial hydrolysis of surface linked 2-azido
acetic ester function. CQDs-4 were synthesized as a control to
check whether the triazole function acts as a passive linker or
not.2223 The morphologies of CQDs-3 and CQDs-4 are
comparable to that of CQDs-1 with an average diameter of
6.25 ± 0.17 nm (Figure 2B) and diﬀraction peak centered at
25.3° for CQDs-3 (see Figure S1A) and an average diameter of
6.50 ± 0.40 nm (Figure 2B), and diﬀraction peak centered at
25.4° for CQDs-4. The Raman spectra of the CQDs-2−4
(Figure 2G) are similar to that of CQDs-1 displaying the
characteristic G and D bands with ID/IG = 0.93 ± 0.15 for all
particles.18 The colloidal stability of CQDs-1−4 in water,
phosphate buﬀer (PBS, 10 mM), and Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (M) was, in addition, examined. All of the
particles had good long-term colloidal stability as seen from the
photographs in Figure 2H.
2.1.2. Cytotoxicity Assay. The cell toxicity of CQDs-1,
CQDs-3, and CQDs-4 was established on Huh-7 cell lines after
8 h (time points corresponding to HCoV-229E infections) and
24 h incubation. The CQDs toxicity was evaluated using cell
viability assessment by the resazurin assay, based on the conversion of nonﬂuorescent dye to a ﬂuorescent molecule by mitochondrial and cytoplasmatic enzymes. All CQDs are nontoxic to Huh-7
cells even at the highest concentration (100 μg mL−1) investigated when incubated for 8 and 24 h (Figure 3A). Neither the
presence of boronic acid nor triazole units had a negative eﬀect
on cell toxicity.
The uptake mechanism proved to be the same for all of the
nanostructures. Taking the example of CQDs-3 (which later
proves to have antiviral activity), Huh-7 cells were ﬁxed after 1 h
incubation at 4 and 37 °C, and then nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342, a ﬂuorescent dye for labeling DNA in ﬂuorescence microcopy (Figure 3B). The green ﬂuorescence, which is
attributed to the CQDs-3, is homogeneously distributed in the
cytoplasm after 1 h when incubated at 37 °C, which conﬁrms the
internalization of CQDs-3 inside the cells. The reduction of
green ﬂuorescence, observed in the cytoplasm after 1 h incubation at 4 °C, suggests that the active internalization mechanism may be partially blocked, and a small portion of CQDs was
internalized by passive penetration.
The endocytosis of CQDs-3 was, in addition, quantitatively
evaluated using ﬂow cytometry by treating Huh-7 cells with
100 μg mL−1 of CQDs-3 for 1 h at 4 °C and for 1, 3, and 6 h at
37 °C (Figure S2). The excitation ﬂuorescence of CQDs-3 at
488 nm allowed analysis of CQDs intracellularly. A progressive
shift in the cell population toward higher ﬂuorescence values was
observed with a subsequent increase of time incubation due to
the time-dependent cellular uptake likely through endocytosis.
Lower ﬂuorescence intensity was observed upon incubation at
4 °C for 1 h, where the active uptake process is blocked. The low
percentage of green cells (0.8%) observed after 1 h at 4 °C

suggests that only a very low quantity of CQDs-3 penetrates via
passive uptake.
2.1.3. Antiviral Assay of First-Generation of Antiviral CQDs.
The antiviral activity of CQDs-1, CQDs-3, and CQDs-4 was
evaluated on Huh-7 cell monolayers, infected with HCoV-229ELuc (Figure 4A). Addition of CQDs-1 after 1 h infection and
further incubation for 6 h at 37 °C shows no inhibition of
infection. This contrasts to CQDs-3 where a concentrationdependent virus inactivation is observed with an estimated EC50
= 52 ± 8 μg mL−1 (Figure 4B). Addition of mannose to CQDs-3
results in a complete loss of antiviral activity of the latter at
low particle concentrations, with some antiviral activity above
50 μg mL−1 CQDs. These data reveal two important ﬁndings.
First, it highlights that boronic acid functions, where the mode of
action is the selective and reversible formation of tetravalent
complexes with cis-diols and thus glycan units,24 are interacting
with HCoV-229E. CQDs-3 are in this context speculated to be
pseudolectins, targeting the S protein of HCoV-229E via a
lectin−carbohydrate binding mechanism, similar to that of the
oligomannose-speciﬁc lectin Griﬃthsin.25 Thus, the presence of
mannose is blocking the antiviral activity in favor of this
mechanistic behavior. The presence of some antiviral activity of
the mannose saturated CQDs-3 might be due to the presence of
the triazole function on the particles’ surface. Indeed, the control
particles CQDs-4, bearing no boronic acid function but a
triazole ring, display some antiviral activity, even though largely
decreased when compared to CQDs-3.
2.2. Second-Generation of CQDs Inhibitors of Host
Cell Infections by HCoV-229E Coronavirus. 2.2.1. Formation and Characterization of CQDs-5−7. With the aim to
validate if boronic acid functions can be formed directly on
CQDs, hydrothermal carbonization of phenylboronic acid and
4-aminophenylboronic acid was performed resulting in CQDs-5
and CQDs-6, respectively (Figure 5A). As control, hydrothermal carbonization of aniline and polyethylene glycol
(PEG600), both lacking boronic acid functions, was conducted.
Unfortunately, several attempts to prepare CQDs from aniline as
a starting material failed (see the Supporting Information for
experimental details).
The TEM images of CQDs-5−7 are seen in Figure 5B. CQDs5 have an average diameter of 9.2 ± 0.3 nm, somehow larger than
CQDs-6 with an average size of 7.6 ± 0.2 nm (Table 2). The
particles formed from PEG (CQDs-7) display a spherical shape
with an average diameter of 8.0 ± 0.2 nm.
The XRD diﬀractograms (see Figure S3A) display broad diffraction peaks centered at 21.3° for CQDs-5, 22.6° for CQDs-6,
and 22.1° for CQDs-7, corresponding to an interlayer spacing of
0.42 nm (CQDs-5), 0.40 nm (CQDs-6), and 0.39 nm (CQDs-7).
The UV−vis absorption spectra of the CQDs are depicted in
Figure S3B. The absorption shoulders at 250−300 nm correspond to a typical absorption of an aromatic π system, in
accordance with the literature data.26 The CQDs exhibit diﬀerent ﬂuorescence quantum yields (QY) of 0.03 (CQDs-5),

Figure 4. Viral infection inhibition in the presence of CQDs: (A) Viral inhibition using CQDs at various concentrations. Huh-7 cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well)
were inoculated with HCoV-229E-Luc for 1 h (in atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C) in the presence or absence of diﬀerent CQDs in medium without
FBS for 1 h. Afterward, the inoculum was removed and replaced by DMEM with FBS for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was quantiﬁed.
The results are expressed as percentage of infection normalized to the control without CQDs, which is expressed as 100% infection. Data are means of
two independent experiments with each treatment performed in triplicate. (B) Determination of EC50 for CQDs-3 and CQDs-4, and eﬀect of viral

these particles. The uptake mechanism of these particles was
comparable and is exempliﬁed using CQDs-6 in Figure S4.
Because of low intrinsic ﬂuorescence of CQDs-6 particles, they
were labeled with ﬂuorescein-NHS.
2.2.2. Antiviral Assay of the Second-Generation of CQDs5−7. Addition of CQDs-7 after 1 h infection and further incubation for 6 h at 37 °C showed no inhibition of infection (Figure 7A),
indicating that these particles are not interfering with HCoV229E-Luc entry or replication. CQDs-5 and CQDs-6 display
a concentration-dependent virus inactivation. The dose−
response curve (Figures 7B) reveals that the eﬀective concentration
to achieve 50% inhibition (EC50) against HCoV-229E-Luc
infection is 5.2 ± 0.7 μg mL−1 for CQDs-6 and 11.6 ± 1.1 μg mL−1
for CQDs-5. Surprisingly, addition of mannose did not result in a
loss of the antiviral activity (Figure 7C), as observed previously
for CQDs-3.
Performing 11B NMR analysis of CQDs-5 and CQDs-6
(Figure 7D) and comparing the obtained spectra to those of the
respective starting materials, 4-aminophenylboronic acid and
phenyl boronic acid (Figure 7E), reveal large diﬀerences in
chemical composition. 4-Aminophenylboronic acid and phenyl
boronic both exhibit a strong signal at around 29 ppm, in accordance with literature data for −B(OH)2 functions.29,30 The small
signal at about 20 ppm arises most likely from residual B(OR)3
often used in boronic acid synthesis.31 The 11B NMR spectra of
CQDs-5 and CQDs-6 display, however, peaks at 13 ppm
(CQDs-5) and a band at 10 ppm with a shoulder at 12 ppm for
CQDs-6. This means that boron was incorporated through
doping rather than surface functionalization, during the hydrothermal reaction. Indeed, one-pot solvothermal synthesis using
aminophenylboronic acid precursor was reported by Wang et al.
to result in N and B codoped CQDs.32 They indeed reported the
presence of 0.7 at. % B by XPS comparable to the amount
obtained here (Table 2).
2.3. Mechanism of Action. We further investigated the
mechanism of action of CQDs-3 and CQDs-6 on viral infection
by performing a time-of-addition assay. CQDs (at 10 μg mL−1)
were added at diﬀerent time points during infection, as represented in Figure 8A. As expected, a strong inhibition of infection
was observed when CQDs were added after 1 h inoculation.
Moreover, the inhibition activity of CQDs was stronger when
the nanoparticles were added during the entry step, that is,
30 minutes before and after inoculation and during inoculation.

the CQDs-5−7 (Figure S3E) are comparable to that of CQDs-1
displaying the characteristic G and D band with ID/IG = 0.93 ±
0.15 for all particles.
The chemical composition of the particles was thus further
assessed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 11B NMR.
The XPS survey spectra of diﬀerent CQDs (Table 2) indicate
the presence of C1s, O1s, N1s, and B1s in agreement with the
chemical composition of the particles. Deconvolution of the C1s
XPS spectrum of CQDs-5 reveals bands located at 284.3 eV
(CC, sp2), 285.1 eV (C−H, C−B), and a small contribution
centered at 287.0 eV (CO) (Figure 5C). The boron content is
lower than that reported by Shen and Xi,27 but comparable to
that reported by Wang et al.28 This indicates that some of the
phenylboronic acid groups were carbonized under our experimental conditions. The low B content might also indicate doping
rather than the presence of boronic acid function. CQDs-6
particles depict bands at 284.3 eV (CC, sp2), 285.2 eV (C−H,
C−B), 287.3 eV (CO), and a band at 290.3 eV due to O−CO
functions. In the case of CQDs-7, the C1s XPS spectrum comprises
three diﬀerent carbon features: the graphitic CC at 283.4 eV,
284.9 eV (C−H), and 286.4 eV (C−O, C−N). Analysis of the
N1s high-resolution spectrum of CQDs-5 reveals the presence of
surface −NH2 groups (Figure 5D).
The FTIR spectra (Figure 5E) of CQDs-5−7 exhibit a distinct
band at 3465 cm−1 attributed to the stretching vibration of −OH
groups and bands at around 2874 and 2924 cm−1 due to CH2
stretching bands. The sharp band at 1618 cm−1 is assigned to
graphitic CC, and the C−H deformation mode is seen at
1460 cm−1. The CO band at ∼1780−1650 cm−1 is also visible
in all cases. In the case of CQDs-6, the band at 1090 cm−1 might
be due to C−B stretching modes. This band is less deﬁned in the
case of CQDs-5, which might underline doping rather than the
presence of boronic acid functions. The FTIR spectrum of
CQDs-7 displays the C−O−C bands of the PEG units at
1043 cm−1.
CQDs-5−7 exhibited a negative zeta potential in water
(pH 7.4) at room temperature and showed excellent long-term
stability even in biological medium such as Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (M) (Figure 5F).
The cytotoxicity of CQDs-5−7 (Figure 6) is comparable to
that of CQDs discussed before (Figure 3), with CQDs-6 being
slightly more toxic at concentrations >25 μg mL−1 after 24 h
incubation. This might be due to the presence of NH2 groups on

not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the entry step as compared
to the replication step. This suggests that, in addition to its major
eﬀect on HCoV-229E entry, CQDs can also aﬀect the genomic
replication of this virus. This could potentially be explained
by an interaction between the CQDs and a cell surface
protein leading to signal transduction aﬀecting viral replication,
or by an interaction with cytosolic proteins as CQDs are
internalized.
To determine if CQDs are interacting directly with viral particles, HCoV-229E-Luc was incubated with CQDs at 10 μg mL−1
for 30 min at 37 °C before inoculation. The inoculum was
diluted 10 times, leading to a ﬁnal concentration of CQDs of
1 μg mL−1, and infection assay was performed. In parallel, Huh-7
cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E-Luc in the presence of
CQDs at 1 or 10 μg mL−1. The inoculum titers were kept
constant in the diﬀerent conditions. The results showed that the
preincubation of the virus with CQDs at high concentration
does not impair HCoV-229E infection, meaning that CQDs are
not interacting with the particles before infection (Figure 8B).
Taken together, our results are in favor of an interaction of
CQDs with cellular factors that may explain their antiviral eﬀects
at diﬀerent steps of infection.

3. CONCLUSION
The viral infection cycle produces important biological and
structural changes in the host cell, resulting in cell damage. The
possibility to interfere with viral attachment to cells as well as
viral replication to reduce viral infection and spreading is an
appropriate antiviral approach. We presented here the antiviral
performance of seven diﬀerent CQDs with their main features
summarized in Table 3. Three of these CQDs (CQDs-3, -5, -6)
were shown to interfere signiﬁcantly with HCoV-229E-Luc
infection in a concentration-dependent manner, while CQDs-4
showed a very moderate antiviral activity. The estimated EC50
value decreased considerably from CQDs-3, boronic acidmodiﬁed quantum dots, derived from ethylenediamine/citric
acid as carbon precursors (EC50 = 52 ± 8 μg mL−1) to 5.2 ±
0.7 μg mL−1 in the case of CQDs-6. While the presence of
boronic acid functions proved to be vital for covering CQDs-3
with antiviral activity, CQDs-5 and CQDS-6 did not carry a
substantial amount of boronic acid functions, as revealed by 11B
NMR and validated by mannose addition experiments. These
ﬁndings reveal the complex nature of identifying viral inhibitors
for human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E-Luc. Mechanistic
studies suggest that the particles are acting at the early state of
virus infection through the inhibition of entry that could be due
to inhibition of protein S-receptor interaction with the host cell
membrane. All diﬀerent particles interfere in addition with the
viral replication step, something less common. These results are
extremely encouraging to replace currently used antiviral agents
such a ribavirin and IFN known to have major side eﬀects such as
confusion, short-term memory loss, deﬁcits in executive
functions, as well as extrapyramidal eﬀects. Further experimental
conﬁrmations are required if this approach can be extrapolated
to other coronaviruses, notably to the clinically relevant MERSCoV, to validate the potential of these nanostructures as
alternative anti-MERS therapeutics and approaches to confront
this severe and life-threatening disease. Also, how such particles
work in vivo has to be shown in the future.

These results agree with our hypothesis of an interaction of
CQDs with HCoV-229E S protein, or an interaction of CQDs
with entry factors. Surprisingly, a strong inhibitory activity
of CQDs was also observed when they were added after 5.5 h
after the entry step, the replication step. The inhibition is

PBS) in a 1:2 volume ratio (v/v). The reaction was carried out for 5 h at
room temperature, and the resulting solution was then dialyzed against
Milli-Q water using cellulose ester dialysis membrane for 24 h (Biotech

unreacted material.
CQDs-3. CQDs-2 were further reacted with “clickable” phenyl boronic
acid derivative 4-[(1-oxo-4-pentyn-1-yl)amino]phenylboronic acid,
synthesized as reported previously.34 For this, CQDs-2 (1 mg mL−1,
5 mL) were mixed with 4-[(1-oxo-4-pentyn-1-yl) amino] phenylboronic acid (2 mM), copper sulfate pentahydrate (200 μM), and
ascorbic acid (300 μM). The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at

For cellular uptake, cells were seeded at a density of 15 × 104 cells/well
in a six-well plate and grown for 48 h before assay. The culture medium
was replaced with a fresh medium that contained 100 μg mL−1 of
CQDs. After 1 h incubation at 4 °C and 1, 3, and 6 h incubation at
37 °C, the Huh-7 cells were washed with PBS (three times) and
collected by trypsinization. The cells suspensions were resuspended in
PBS/PFA 0.5% and analyzed through a ﬂow cytometer (BD LSR
Fortessa) with FITC channel. The data were collected (104 cells per
sample) and analyzed using BD FACSDiva 8.0.1 software.
Antiviral Assay: HCoV-229E-Luc. We used a modiﬁed HCoV-229E
containing a renilla luciferase reporter gene HCoV-229E-Luc. The viral
stocks were produced in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were infected with a
prestock of HCoV-229E-Luc in ﬂasks. After 5 days, the supernatants of
ﬂasks were collected. For infection assay, Huh-7 cells, 15 000/well
seeded in 96-well plate, were inoculated with HCoV-229E-Luc at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 during 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM
without serum, and then the inoculum was removed and cells were
incubated in complete culture medium for 6 h at 37 °C. CQDs were
added to cells during the 1 h of infection. Cells were lysed in 20 μL of
Renilla Lysis Buﬀer (Promega, Madison, WI) and luciferase activity
quantiﬁed using a Renilla Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega,
Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer and a Tristar LB
941 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany).
To measure EC50, dose−response experiment was performed with
CQDs added at diﬀerent concentrations during inoculation step and
postinoculation step. For time-of-addition assays, CQDs were added at
diﬀerent time points at 10 μg mL−1. For all experiments, water was used
as a control because CQDs are diluted in water.
Statistical Analysis. The statistical test used is a Mann−Whitney
nonparametric with a conﬁdence interval of 95%. The data were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0b) by comparison between
treated and untreated groups (DMSO control). P values of 0.05 were
considered to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the control.

CQDs-4. CQDs-2 were further reacted with commercially available
propargyl alcohol. For this, CQDs-2 (1 mg mL−1, 5 mL) were mixed
with propargyl alcohol (2 mM), copper sulfate pentahydrate (200 μM),
and ascorbic acid (300 μM). The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at
room temperature. EDTA was added to the mixture prior to dialysis
(SpectraPor 1, pore size: 1000 Da) against Milli-Q water for 48 h.
CQDs-5 and CQDS-6. Particles were prepared according to the
protocol recently described by us.12
CQDs-7. Particles were prepared in a manner similar to that for
CQDs-2 by dissolving PEG600 (200 mg) in water (20 mL) and
adjusting the pH to 9.0 by adding NaOH (0.5 M). The solution was
degassed with nitrogen gas during 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen and
heated in a Teﬂon-lined autoclave chamber (125 mL − acid digestion
vessel no. 4748, Parr, France) for 72 h at 120 °C. After being cooled to
room temperature, the solution was dialyzed against water for 24 h with
water being changed every 6 h (SpectraPor 1, pore size: 3500 Da).
4.3. Biological Assays. Cell and Toxicity Assay. The Huh-7
hepatocarcinoma cell line was cultured and maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Gibco) in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were
seeded at a density of 15 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate and grown
for 24 h before assay. The culture medium was replaced with a fresh
medium that contains increasing concentrations of CQDs for 2 and 8 h
from 1 to 100 μg mL−1. The old medium was then aspirated, and cells
were washed with PBS. The cell viability was evaluated using resazurin
cell viability assay. Brieﬂy, 100 mL of the resazurin solution (11 μg mL−1)
in DMEM/10% FBS was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 4 h in the humidiﬁed incubator. The ﬂuorescence emission of
each well was measured at 593 nm (20 nm bandwidth) with an excitation at 554 nm (18 nm bandwidth) using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging
Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments SAS, France). Each condition was replicated three times, and the mean ﬂuorescence value of
nonexposed cells was taken as 100% cellular viability.
Fluorescent Labeling of CQDs: Uptake Mechanism. To study the
uptake mechanism of the particles into cells, CQDs were dissolved in
PBS buﬀer (pH 7.4) at the concentration of 2 mg mL−1. FluoresceinNHS was dissolved in DMF (10 mg mL−1). A solution of CQDs-5 was
cooled to 0 °C, and 10 μL of freshly prepared ﬂuorescein-NHS solution
was added. The reaction was stirred on ice for another 3 h. To remove
the excess of the ﬂuorescein dye, a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 desalting
column was used. Cells were seeded at a density of 15 × 104 cells/well in
a 24-well plate with sterile coverslips at the bottom and grown for 24 h
before assay. The culture medium was replaced with a fresh medium
that contained 100 μg mL−1 of CQDs. After 1 h incubation at 4 and
37 °C, the Huh-7 cells were washed with PBS (three times), ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and then stained
with 10 μg mL−1 Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature
in the dark. After being washed with PBS, the coverslips were mounted
on glass slides and recorded using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging MultiMode Reader (BioTek Instruments SAS, France) equipped with 40×
objective (Plan Fluorite WD 2.7 NA 0.6). The ﬂuorescence images
were acquired with the same exposure using DAPI (377/447 nm) and
GFP (469/525 nm) excitation/emission ﬁlter sets. All of the images
were processed using Gen5 Image+ software.
