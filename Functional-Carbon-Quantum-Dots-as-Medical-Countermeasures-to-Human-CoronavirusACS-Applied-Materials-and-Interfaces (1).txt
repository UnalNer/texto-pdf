Therapeutic options for the highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections are urgently needed. Anticoronavirus therapy is
however challenging, as coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly
mutating. In this work, the antiviral activity of seven diﬀerent carbon
quantum dots (CQDs) for the treatment of human coronavirus HCoV229E infections was investigated. The ﬁrst generation of antiviral CQDs
was derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric
acid as carbon precursors and postmodiﬁed with boronic acid ligands.
These nanostructures showed a concentration-dependent virus inactivation with an estimated EC50 of 52 ± 8 μg mL−1. CQDs derived from
4-aminophenylboronic acid without any further modiﬁcation resulted in
the second-generation of anti-HCoV nanomaterials with an EC50 lowered
to 5.2 ± 0.7 μg mL−1. The underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs
was revealed to be inhibition of HCoV-229E entry that could be due to
interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with HCoV-229E entry receptors; surprisingly, an equally large inhibition
activity was observed at the viral replication step.

high case-fatality rate (35%).4 As the virus is circulating in animals and humans, it may undergo further adaptation and cause a
pandemic. Therefore, therapeutic options are urgently needed.
The current treatments for MERS-CoV are extrapolated from
SARS-CoV and H1N1 inﬂuenza outbreaks.5−7 These include
diﬀerent combinations of small molecules with broad antiviral
activity (e.g., ribavirin, corticosteroids, and interferons (IFN)),
and monoclonal and polyclonal antibody therapies.7,8 The
membrane-anchored glycoprotein S has lately been found to be
essential for the interaction between the MERS-CoV and the
host cell,8,9 and the development of MERS-CoV entry/fusion
inhibitors targeting the S1 subunit is nowadays considered as a
viable antiviral strategy.
Recently, nanoscale materials have emerged as promising and
eﬃcient platforms to modulate the viral infection cycle.10 Given

The eradication of viral infections is an ongoing challenge in the
medical ﬁeld, not only due to the problem of spreading but also
to the virus’ ability to escape therapy by genetic mutations. The
lack of targeted antiviral therapeutics as well as the constant
emergence of new viruses make the search for antiviral agents a
challenging and extremely needed research task.1 As part of a
global strategy to prevent epidemics, some severe emerging
pathogens with great epidemic potential have been identiﬁed by
the World Health Organization (WHO),2 including, next to
Ebola virus disease, the highly pathogenic human coronavirus
(HCoV) infections. While circulating HCoVs (HCoV-229E,
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1) cause relatively mild
common cold-like respiratory tract infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) lead to pneumonia requiring hospitalization and intensive care.3 A total of 2266
laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 804 associated deaths, have been declared to the WHO until now, with a
