Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is common among cats living indoors in groups. In about 10% of infected cats, a
potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian®
Xraphconn (Mutian X) is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding,
although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum
dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding
cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces
were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the
virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg
q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Posttreatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since
failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before
treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than
recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001). This is the first report of the successful
elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.

1. Introduction
Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a positive strand RNA virus ubiquitous
in multi-cat environments such as breeding catteries, rescue shelters,
cat sanctuaries and large cats in zoos, but rare in stray and feral cats.
(Addie et al., 2012; Cave et al., 2004). Two FCoV genotypes are currently known: FCoV type I (FCoV-I), which is predominant in the field,
(Addie et al., 2003; Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Li et al., 2019) and FCoV
type II (FCoV-II), which derives from recombination between FCoV-I
and canine coronavirus (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008; Herrewegh
et al., 1998; Terada et al., 2014).
FCoV is primarily a pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats, replicating in the intestines and is spread by faecal-oral
transmission from cats that are either persistently or transiently

infected (Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie et al., 2003). FCoV infections
are often subclinical, but may result in a number of problematic conditions such as acute and chronic diarrhoea, stunting of kittens or
transient upper respiratory signs in newly infected kittens and cats, and
faecal incontinence in persistently infected carrier cats (Addie and
Jarrett, 1992; Kipar et al., 1998). FCoV RNA was found in five of 14 cats
with chronic caecocolic disease, although it was unclear if FCoV was
the cause of the lesions (Hahn et al., 2017).
Some cats that acquire the infection, typically 7–14% (Addie et al.,
1995) develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), until recently considered to be an almost uniformly fatal disease. However, in a major
advance, Pedersen et al. (2019) found recently that FIP can be cured by
the parenteral administration of GS-441524, a novel antiviral nucleoside analogue. While this drug has yet to be licensed for veterinary use,

several products, some specifically described as GS-441524, and others
with proprietary names, are being sold through the internet to cat
guardians who treat their own cats suffering from FIP.
FCoV persists in multicat households by infection and re-infection of
healthy cats by the same, or another, strain of virus and by the development of a persistently infected carrier status in 13% of FCoV-infected
cats which act as reservoirs of infection in a feline population without
developing FIP (Addie et al., 1995; Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie
et al., 2003; Herrewegh et al., 1997). There is an urgent need of
methods to prevent cats in high density environments such as breeding
and rescue catteries becoming infected with FCoV. An FIP vaccine is
licensed in some countries, but the first dose is administered at
16 weeks (Gerber et al., 1990) which is too late to protect kittens, that
are usually infected when maternally derived antibody wanes at between five and seven weeks of age (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Pedersen
et al., 1981). At present, therefore, the major way to prevent FIP is to
prevent exposure to the virus by quarantine and rigorous hygiene. FCoV
transmission is faecal-oral; sharing litter trays with a FCoV shedder and
fomite transmission are the major risk factors for uninfected cats. In dry
indoor environments, FCoV can survive up to seven weeks in fomites
(Scott, 1988).
Another method of control would be to stop the excretion of virus in
the faeces of infected cats by antiviral therapy. Some cat guardians have
considered whether the drugs shown to cure FIP might also stop
asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats shedding virus, thereby preventing
them acting as a source of infection and providing a means to establish
households of cats that are free of the virus. Mutian® X (Nantong
Mutian Biotechnology Co. Ltd. China) is one of those products, it is
formulated in capsules containing nicotinamide mononucleotide,
Crocin I, S-Adenosylmethionine, Silymarin and Mutian X, which is a
novel synthetic adenosine analogue (patent pending in China), exhibiting broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses (Tony Xue, CEO
of Nantong, personal communication). Nucleoside analogues function
by replacing adenosine, thus terminating replication of the RNA virus
genome. Mutian X is efficacious by the oral route unlike previously
described anti-coronavirus drugs, which must be given by painful injection, often causing severe inflammatory responses (Pedersen et al.,
2019), which is of concern for the development of feline injection site
sarcoma.
Although recombinant feline interferon omega (FeIFNω: Virbagen
Omega, Virbac, France) was previously shown to reduce FCoV shedding, this is the first report to document an anti-viral that stopped the
excretion of FCoV in the faeces of naturally infected cats.

using Mutian X tablets: we worked with her to optimise dose and
duration of treatment for stopping virus shedding.
2.2. Faecal sample origin and preparation
Faecal samples were mailed to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
(VDL) at the University of Glasgow, UK. The samples were mailed using
Royal Mail or FedEx: they were not on ice, nor in RNA-preserving
buffer. Cat guardians were advised to try to submit faecal samples with
no cat litter attached, since cat litter can inhibit the PCR reaction.
2.3. FCoV reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction
FCoV RNA was detected by semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as previously described (Dunbar
et al., 2019), except that to control for false negative results GAPDH
was replaced by a control for PCR inhibitors in faecal samples, the exact
nature of this control cannot be revealed because the laboratory deems
it a commercial secret. Testing was performed in duplicate. Those
performing the FCoV RT-qPCR tests were blinded to which treatments
the cats were receiving. Threshold cycle (CT) number was used as the
measure of viral load. The lower the CT, the more virus present in the
sample. Samples with no signal at CT 40 were considered negative.
2.4. Treatment protocols
Cat guardians purchased Mutian X online. Mutian X was available in
either tablet format, containing 4 mg of the anti-viral Mutian X ingredient, or capsules (Mutian X 200) containing 10 mg. The exact
nature of Mutian X is a commercial secret, prior to Chinese patent being
granted: the manufacturer describes it as an adenosine nucleoside
analogue (Tony Xue, personal communication).
Cat guardians were using 4 mg/kg q24 hours per os for seven days
as per advice from social media groups for stopping FCoV shedding. The
owner of Household C (SC) was experimenting with different doses and
protocols with the aim of minimising dose and duration of treatment to
stop faecal virus shedding: we report the outcome of using 2 mg/kg and
4 mg/kg doses. The owners of Household E (FB and BC) set up a camera
and alarm system which enabled the recording of the exact number of
hours post onset of treatment that a faecal sample was passed, and to
ensure the samples were not contaminated or degraded.
Prior to the use of Mutian X, cat guardians were attempting to
prevent FCoV transmission within their households by quarantining FIP
cats (Households A and D), keeping cats in as small groups as possible
given their facilities (Households C and E), and using Dr. Elsey Cat
Attract cat litter (Addie et al., 2019) or other bentonite-based cat litter
(Households A and E respectively). Some households also tried to reduce FCoV shedding using probiotics, recombinant FeIFNω, and a
21 day course of itraconazole (Households A and D) which has been
shown to have in vitro activity against Type I FCoV (Takano et al.,
2019). These various treatments were grouped into a single control
period for each Household (Figs. 1–3), since numbers of cats for each of
these parameters were too small to be statistically significant, and also
because combinations of prevention strategies were used.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cats
FCoV testing was implemented because the households had experienced FIP among their cats. A summary of the cats and the reasons
for screening for FCoV shedding is shown in Table 1.
Thirty-four of 50 cats in five multicat households (A-E) were naturally infected with FCoV and were treated with Mutian X. Results from
five cats from Household E could not be included because the intervals
between faecal tests left the possibility that the cats might have spontaneously stopped shedding virus, rather than Mutian X having stopped
virus shedding: thus they were excluded from both treatment and
control groups (Table 1). Therefore, there remained data of 29 cats
treated with Mutian X.
Household C was a Ragdoll breeding cattery with a history of endemic FCoV for at least four years despite testing for FCoV antibodies
and shedding, and rigorous hygiene. In 2015 this cattery experienced
eight FIP deaths. Keeping cats in small groups or singly to attempt to
prevent FCoV transmission resulted in clearance of virus in eight of 24
cats. Prior to the observational study we report here, the cattery owner
(SC) discovered she could reduce coronavirus shedding in some cats

2.5. Statistical analysis
This was an observational study so that there was no opportunity to
conduct a placebo-controlled trial. However, FCoV shedding records
prior to treatment with Mutian X, where available, were used as a
retrospective control period. Cats acted as their own controls, which
meant that variables such as housing, breed, and age, which affect FCoV
shedding, were constant.
Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) and correlation coefficient were
carried out using the statistics package in Excel (Microsoft Office 2007).

FCoV positive

Initially all four cats shed virus. Cat A1 had effusive FIP diagnosed by a positive FCoV RT-qPCR test on ascites (Herrewegh et al., 1995; Longstaff et al., 2017;
Lorusso et al., 2019). Cat A1 ceased virus shedding following treatment with FeIFNω, itraconazole, and GC376 protease inhibitor injections (Pedersen et al.,
2018).
Cat A1 was kept isolated from the other three cats and they were tested for FCoV shedding prior to re-uniting them, in order not to re-infect Cat A1. Cat A2
stopped shedding virus subsequent to seven injections of GC376 given because FIP was suspected, but his condition was a urinary tract infection which resolved
with antibiotics. Thus Mutian X was only required for Cats A3 and A4. Dr. Elsey Cat Attract cat litter (Addie et al., 2019) was used and Cat A2 remained
uninfected despite continued sharing of litter trays with cats A3 and A4.
All four cats tested FCoV negative five months after their first negative faecal tests.
Cat B1 was in contact with Cat B2 who was treated for FIP using Mutian II injections and Mutian X tablets prior to this study. Cat B1 was shedding FCoV.
Cats were routinely tested because this was a breeding cattery wishing to eliminate FCoV, and therefore FIP. Eight FIP deaths had occurred prior to testing
beginning.
At the start of the Mutian X treatment, 14 of 24 cats were shedding FCoV; one FCoV shedding cat (C10) was introduced during the study period (the breeder
having confidence in her ability to stop Cat C10 shedding virus using Mutian X). Cats were kept in small groups of up to three cats. Sawdust based cat litter was
used. Two of ten negative cats became infected during the study period, bringing the total treated to 17.
Cat D2 had effusive FIP diagnosed by a positive FCoV RT-qPCR test on ascites but was not shedding virus in the faeces. D1 was the housemate cat found to be
shedding FCoV and was treated to avoid re-infecting cat D2. A 21 day itraconazole course had failed to stop Cat D1 shedding virus.
One cat died of histopathologically suspected FIP prior to this study (immunohistochemistry was not performed to confirm diagnosis). FIP was suspected in a
second cat (E14) and GS-441524 treatment was begun; but he had multicentric lymphoma, so the anti-viral drug was stopped. Cats were divided into three
groups of up to eight cats. ten cats became infected during the study period despite clumping bentonite-based cat litter being used.
Results of five infected cats (E6, E8, E10, E11 and E13), could not be counted as having stopped shedding due to Mutian X because of the absence of a faecal
sample immediately prior to Mutian X treatment: it is therefore possible that they had ceased shedding virus prior to onset of treatment. However, it is also
possible that they had stopped shedding virus within 24 hours of treatment.

Households A and B.
In this graph, the records of faecal FCoV RNA detection—RT-qPCR CT—is
shown on the y axis and the time in days on the x axis for three cats A3, A4 and
B1. Each time point indicates a faecal test. This graph is normalised to time zero
for test period for Mutian X start.
Mutian X was given for seven days from Days 0 to Cats A3, A4, and B1 after
which their faecal samples remained negative for 155, 157 and 51 days (x axis
only shows up to 60 days). The graph shows that no intermittent virus shedding
or re-infection occurred.

3. Results
The results are summarised in Table 2. Prior to this study, the owner
of Household C had attempted various Mutian X treatment regimes in
her cats. A single dose treatment was attempted on two cats (C10 and
C12) and while virus load reduced, it failed to clear infection and virus
load increased again in Cat C10. Cat C1 was given a single injection of
Mutian three days prior to oral treatment which had reduced her virus
shedding from CT 20 to 32. Thus a single dose was ineffective at
clearing infection and may have risked the emergence of resistant
viruses.

dose of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg q24 h in Households C and D.
Faecal FCoV RNA detection—RT-qPCR CT—is shown on the y axis and the time
in days on the x axis for ten cats treated with Mutian X at an oral dose of 2 mg/
kg SID (Fig. 2A), and for eleven cats at a dose of 4 mg/kg SID (Fig. 2B). Each
time point indicates a faecal test. These graphs are normalised to time zero for
the start of the Mutian X treatment and cut off at Day 60 and 400 prior to
testing: the exact extent of the no treatment control period is indicated in
Table 2.
Two cats (C8 and C10) failed to clear the infection at 2 mg/kg dose (Fig. 2A)
and were treated again at 4 mg/kg (Fig. 2B). Cat C6 was kept in a group with
Cats C8 and C10, became re-infected, and required re-treatment, which is why
this cat also features in both figures.

3.1. Results of Mutian X at a dose of 2 mg/kg
Ten cats received a full course at 2 mg/kg and two other cats began
at 2 mg/kg then were increased to 4 mg/kg. Eight of ten cats stopped
shedding FCoV using Mutian X tablets at a dose of 2 mg/kg SID
(Fig. 2A) for seven or four days. Two probable FCoV carrier cats (C1
and C2) that had shed virus at levels of CT 18–20 (C1) and CT 35 (C2)
for over a year prior to treatment were treated for seven days at a dose
of 2 mg/kg after which their faeces were negative, C1 and C2 remained
negative when tested five and seven days later.
The remaining eight cats were treated for four days as shown in
Fig. 2A and Table 2. Daily samples were available for five cats; two (C3
and C5) cleared the virus within 24 hours and three under 72 h (C4, C6
and C7). The other cats were not tested daily, so an accurate time of
cessation of virus shedding could not be determined.
Cats C8 and C10 failed to totally clear the virus using the 2 mg/kg
dose for four days; therefore they were treated again at 4 mg/kg, after
which they became negative, as shown in Fig. 2B and Table 2. Cat C6
was in the same group as C8 and C10, and began shedding virus again
within nine days, requiring a second course of treatment (Figs. 2A and
B).
Two more cats (E1 and E2) started treatment at 2 mg/kg SID but
were changed to the higher dose within 48 hours due to the results from
Household C (Fig. 3): these cats were therefore included in the 4 mg/kg
rather than the 2 mg/kg category.
In summary, a Mutian X dose of 2 mg/kg was considered inadequate: it had cleared the virus in eight cats and reduced, but not
abrogated, virus shedding in two cats (Fig. 2A). Thereafter, the dose

was increased to 4 mg/kg.
3.2. Results of Mutian X at a dose of 4 mg/kg
A dose of 4 mg/kg reliably cleared virus within seven days in 21 of
22 (95%) cats (two cats from Household A, one from Household B, ten
of eleven from Household C and eight from Household E) (Figs.2B and
3). Cat C18 was the only cat who failed to clear the virus after a six day
course of 4 mg/kg dose, but she vomited some of the capsules and she
required a repeat course for three more days after which she was negative.
3.3. Summary: Mutian X cleared 29 cats of FCoV infection
Ten cats received a full course of Mutian X at 2 mg/kg: eight cats
(80%) cleared infection, but Cats C8 and C10 did not, and Cat C6 who
was housed with them, began shedding virus again. Therefore at the
end of that part of the study seven cats were clear of virus, and three
required to be re-treated at 4 mg/kg.

4. Discussion
Mutian X pills stopped faecal FCoV shedding in 29 naturally infected cats; however, four of the 29 cats required a second course of
treatment before virus was eliminated.
Since successful treatment of FIP using anti-viral drugs was first
reported (Pedersen et al., 2018; Pedersen et al., 2019) cat guardians
have been able to source various anti-FCoV drugs, including Mutian X,
via social media. Our view is that it is preferable that if they propose to
use such medications, even though the products are unlicensed, they
should do so under proper veterinary guidance, rather than following
advice from social media group moderators, however knowledgeable.
Professor Pedersen has provided a lucid view of the current situation in
relation to the treatment of cats with FIP with ‘black market’ drugs, and
the subsequent dilemma for veterinary surgeons. (https://ccah.vetmed.
ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk4586/files/inline-files/Black
%20market%20production%20and%20sale%20of%20GS_0.pdf).
To paraphrase Professor Niels Pedersen, we would prefer that these
drugs be approved, licensed, and made available in the normal manner,
rather than being sold on the black market, but we are willing to advise
veterinary surgeons and their clients. Advice from those with FIP experience is likely to reduce unnecessary use of anti-coronavirus drugs:
in two of the five households reported here FIP therapy levels of antiviral treatment was begun in two cats which did not have FIP, and
ceased when a proper diagnosis was obtained: anti-viral treatment has
been stopped in nine other mis-diagnosed cats (DA personal observation). We present an observational study of cat guardians who were
using Mutian X to stop their cats from shedding virus, and have defined
a protocol which optimises and minimises its use. Furthermore, we
hope that by stopping cats shedding FCoV, especially in purebred cats,
the prevalence of FIP will reduce, which will further reduce the use of
unlicensed drugs.
A four day course of Mutian X at a dose of 2 mg/kg cleared coronavirus in eight cats, but failed to clear infection in Cats C8 and C10.
Some opinion leaders have expressed concern that use of Mutian X to
stop virus shedding in cats without FIP will lead to drug resistance and
failure of the drug to treat FIP, although the ability of Mutian X to treat
FIP has not actually yet been documented, so far as we are aware. We
ask those holding such views to consider the following: first that this
drug is already being used for the purpose of virus elimination by cat
guardians and surely it is better that a proper protocol has been developed, rather than they are left to do trial and error themselves.
Second, we have found that an intensive four day course stopped virus
shedding while cats being treated for FIP have higher virus loads (Kipar
et al., 2006) and require a longer course of treatment, up to 12 weeks
(Pedersen et al., 2019), which surely is more likely to allow resistant
virus strains to develop? Indeed, virus resistance to a nucleoside analogue was documented in a cat being treated for FIP (Pedersen et al.,
2019). Anti-virals are used prophylactically in other viral infections:
there is precedent for this approach.
We found no evidence for the development of drug resistance in
asymptomatic cats at a dose of 4 mg/kg. In our view treating breeding
queens for four days to stop FCoV shedding is less likely to induce drug
resistance than treating at least one in ten of their kittens for FIP, requiring 12 weeks of medication. However, treatment of virus shedding
cats must be done properly: one concern is that cat guardians may be
tempted to reduce cost and use an insufficient dose or duration of
treatment (SC and DDA, personal observations), which might result in
selection of viruses which are resistant to Mutian X. Another concern is
that a blunderbuss approach may be taken: treating all the cats in a
household without first confirming that they are virus shedders.
No correlation was found between FCoV RNA CT prior to treatment
and time to become negative, therefore cats shedding more virus did
not require a longer treatment course than cats shedding a lower
amount of virus and a four day course is likely to suffice, rather than
seven days.

Fig. 3. Faecal FCoV shedding before and after treatment with Mutian X in
Household E.
Faecal FCoV RNA detection—RT-qPCR CT—is shown on the y axis and the time
in days on the x axis for eight cats in Household E treated with Mutian X at an
oral dose of 4 mg/kg SID for four days (Cats E1 and E2 were started on a dose of
2 mg/kg, but increased to 4 mg/kg). Each time point indicates a faecal test. Cat
results are normalised to time zero for the start of the Mutian X treatment.

Twenty-two cats received a course of Mutian X at a dose of 4 mg/kg
and 21 cats (95%) became negative. Cat C18, who had vomited some of
the capsules, required re-treatment, after which she too, became negative. Thus all 29 cats were cleared of infection, but four cats had
required a second course of treatment.
3.4. Cats shedding more virus did not require a longer course of Mutian X
To determine whether cats that were shedding a higher amount of
virus required more days of anti-viral treatment than cats with a lower
virus quantity, starting FCoV RNA CT was plotted against days to become negative. Serial accurately timed daily faecal samples were
available for 14 cats (Fig. 4) and all 14 cleared virus within 75 h of
starting treatment.
No correlation between starting FCoV RNA CT and time to become
negative was found (R = 0.0048.
3.5. Comparison of Mutian X vs cessation of virus shedding control periods
Pre-treatment virus shedding records were used as a retrospective
control in this observational study: FCoV virus shedding results prior to
Mutian X administration were available for 25 treated cats (shown in
Table 2). Two additional cats in Household C spontaneously stopped
shedding virus prior to the start of treatment period (data not shown):
one cat was kept in isolation and one was allowed outdoors. Therefore
two of 27 (7.4%) cats stopped shedding virus during the control period:
the difference between the number of cats stopping shedding virus
during the control period and subsequent to Mutian X at 4 mg/kg was
statistically significant (p < .00001).
3.6. Cats that had cleared virus using Mutian X did not spontaneously begin
shedding virus again
Repeat negative samples were available from six cats dosed at 2 mg/
kg and 12 cats dosed at 4 mg/kg (Table 2). Cats dosed at 2 mg/kg and
4 mg/kg remained negative for at least three to 18 days and one to
157 days respectively from their first negative result, showing that the
cats remained negative post-treatment and did not start spontaneously
shedding virus again. FCoV antibody titres were available for Cats A3
and A4 five months post-treatment: they had reduced from 1280 to 80
and from over 1280 to 320 respectively.

This table shows the duration of 29 FCoV shedding cats either not treated, or treated with itraconazole, or FeIFNω and probiotics, compared with duration of virus
shedding on Mutian X treatment. Cats are organised according to their groups in their homes. Cats C6, C8 and C10 are listed twice. Although none of 25 cats for
which pre-treatment records were available stopped shedding virus during the control period, this table does not show the virus shedding of untreated cats, two of
which became negative in Household C prior to the study.
a
Cat C12 was treated for one day, missed a day, one day of 2 mg/kg then 2 days of 4 mg/kg - low positive at CT 38. Then 3 days of 4 mg/kg then negative.
b
Cat C18 faecal sample was CT 38 at Day 6 and so the cat was re-treated for 3 days and subsequently became negative. This cat had vomited some of the capsules.

Since the study was observational rather than prospective, there was
no formal placebo group. The lack of a placebo group in this study was
problematic: it could be argued that the cats spontaneously stopped
shedding FCoV, co-incidental with the onset of Mutian X therapy. Cats
do spontaneously stop shedding FCoV some months post-infection:
FCoV-I is shed in the faeces for months to years (Addie et al., 1995;
Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie et al., 2003). Little is known about
FCoV-II shedding, in one experimental infection of laboratory cats virus
was shed for up to 15 days (Stoddart et al., 1988); and no persistently
FCoV-II infected cat has been reported (Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie
et al., 2003). That said, it is unlikely that 29 cats would all cease virus
shedding co-incidentally within days of beginning Mutian X treatment,
we did retrospectively compare the results prior to Mutian X, when
virus eradication was attempted by quarantine and hygiene, and/or
itraconazole, and FeIFNω with and without probiotics.
Another argument might be that the cats stopped shedding virus as
a delayed result of the treatments given to some cats prior to Mutian X:
this argument could not apply to Households B, C, and E, where the cats
did not receive any other treatments. However, in Household A, virus
load did decrease in two cats on probiotics (Fortiflora, Purina Pro Plan,

USA) and FeIFNω, but remained at a constant level in the third cat.
Therefore, a combination of interferon and probiotics may have reduced FCoV shedding. FeIFNω has previously been shown to reduce,
but not stop, FCoV shedding (Gil et al., 2013). Probiotics are routinely
used to treat children with viral diarrhoea (Szajewska et al., 2019), but
the interaction of the gut microbiome and FCoV has not been extensively explored (Meazzi et al., 2019): further investigation into the
possibility that probiotics might reduce coronavirus load is warranted.
Cats in Households A and D also received itraconazole which has
been shown to have in-vitro activity against FCoV-I (Takano et al.,
2019). However, a 21 day course of treatment failed to clear these three
cats of FCoV, although viral RNA quantity did decrease in Cat A3 while
she was on itraconazole, but bounced back as soon as it was stopped.
Another possibility was that the Mutian X could be excreted in the
faeces and be inhibiting the FCoV RT-qPCR assay, but this was unlikely
because, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, FCoV RNA was being detected in
cats during Mutian X treatment, and also because faecal samples remained negative after the cats had ceased Mutian X.
While a four-day course of Mutian X tablets at 4 mg/kg appeared to
be effective in stopping FCoV shedding, daily monitoring of faecal FCoV

naturally infected cats. This treatment would be a useful adjunct for
establishing FCoV-free households of cats, in addition to current measures of hygiene, housing cats in small groups and the use of virusinhibiting cat litter (Addie et al., 2019). Further observations of cats
which stopped shedding virus should determine whether Mutian X can
prevent the development of FIP. Also, if the serum anti-FCoV titres of
treated cats decline over the coming year, it will indicate that the virus
has been cleared systemically, as well as from the gastrointestinal tract.
Funding
Cats' guardians funded the treatment and blood testing of their pets.
We are indebted to www.catvirus.com Angelica Trust donors who
funded much of the FCoV RT-qPCR testing. DDA is hugely grateful to
catvirus.com subscribers for supporting her through the writing of this
paper.

Fig. 4. Lower FCoV RNA CT did not correlate with requirement for a longer
duration of treatment.
The aim of this scatter plot was to determine whether cats that were shedding a
higher amount of virus required more days of anti-viral treatment than cats
with a lower virus quantity. Daily monitoring of faeces was available for 14 cats
(there are 4 results at CT 23, two are overlaid which gives an appearance of 13
samples). Although there was a slight incline in the trendline, there was no
correlation between starting FCoV RNA CT and days to a negative result
(R = 0.0048).

shedding using a laboratory which rapidly reports virus quantity is
necessary to tailor treatment duration according to the circumstances of
each individual cat. The virus is highly contagious, and if cats are
sharing litter trays, they will be rapidly re-infected, as was the experience in Households C and E, with large numbers of cats, even though
they were kept in small groups. In Household C, re-infection of cat C6
occurred in less than nine days: she was housed with one cat who had
failed to clear the virus on a 2 mg/kg dose of Mutian X; the cat litter
used was sawdust based. It could be argued that Cat C6 was shedding
virus intermittently, but C6 was housed in a group who had failed to
clear virus at the 2 mg/kg dose, thus was far more likely to have been
re-infected than latently infected.
Intermittent virus shedding was not seen in any cat in this trial, nor
in previous studies of sequential tests on hundreds of cats using the
modern, sensitive FCoV RT-qPCR technology (Addie, unpublished observation), and controlling for false negative results due to faecal PCR
inhibitors (Dye et al., 2008). In our experience, cats either shed virus
continuously or they stop shedding virus: the appearance of intermittent virus shedding could always be traced back to exposure to the
faeces of an infected cat; or where virus quantity was so low that it was
on the borderline of the ability of the assay to detect it, or by the
presence of excessive cat litter on the sample: sodium bentonite based
cat litters bind organic material.
No side effects of Mutian X were observed by us other than one cat
having initially vomited some capsules, which might have been an
adverse reaction, although that cat didn't vomit subsequent capsules.
However, that does not mean that Mutian X is without side effects:
elevation of liver enzymes has been seen in cats with FIP that are being
treated for many weeks (Addie, unpublished observation).
Use of a laboratory that has an adequately sensitive FCoV RT-qPCR
test is absolutely essential for the detection and eradication of FCoV
from a household. False negative results will doom the effort to failure.
Six of eight samples sent to one highly reputable university veterinary
laboratory were falsely reported as negative (data not shown). A major
problem identified during our study was that the delay in reporting
FCoV RT-qPCR results—usually of at least one week from the date of
sample submission—delayed separation of negative and positive cats,
and allowed re-infection of cats that had cleared infection.

We sincerely thank the guardians of the cats for allowing their data
to be used to help other cats, with special mention to Eric and Carrie,
for their commitment to saving their cats.
