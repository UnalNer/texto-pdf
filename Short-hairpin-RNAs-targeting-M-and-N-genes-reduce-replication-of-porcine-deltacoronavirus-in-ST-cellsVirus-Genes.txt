Abstract
Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a recently identified coronavirus that causes intestinal diseases in neonatal piglets
with diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and post-infection mortality of 50–100%. Currently, there are no effective treatments
or vaccines available to control PDCoV. To study the potential of RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against PDCoV
infection, two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids (pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N) that targeted the M and N
genes of PDCoV were constructed and transfected separately into swine testicular (ST) cells, which were then infected with
PDCoV strain HB-BD. The potential of the plasmids to inhibit PDCoV replication was evaluated by cytopathic effect, virus
titers, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The cytopathogenicity assays demonstrated that pGenesil-M and pGenesilN protected ST cells against pathological changes with high specificity and efficacy. The 50% tissue culture infective dose
showed that the PDCoV titers in ST cells treated with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N were reduced 13.2- and 32.4-fold,
respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that the amount of viral RNA in cell cultures pre-transfected
with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N was reduced by 45.8 and 56.1%, respectively. This is believed to be the first report to show
that shRNAs targeting the M and N genes of PDCoV exert antiviral effects in vitro, which suggests that RNAi is a promising
new strategy against PDCoV infection.

Introduction
Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a new member of the
Deltacoronavirus genus Coronavirus that causes intestinal
disease. Clinical symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea,
dehydration, and even death of piglets [1–3]. Since the first
report of PDCoV in Hong Kong in 2012 [4] and the outbreak of PDCoV in the USA in 2014 [5], the novel porcine

coronavirus has been detected in Canada, South Korea,
Thailand, Mexico, and China [3, 6–8]. PDCoV has become
an important pathogen affecting healthy development in the
pig industry. However, there are currently no vaccines or
treatments that can effectively control PDCoV [6].
PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, and positivesense RNA virus. The entire genome contains about 25,400
nucleotides [4]. PDCoV has four major structural proteins:
spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid
(N) [1, 2, 9]. The detailed function of each PDCoV proteins
is unknown. According to studies on other coronaviruses, M
protein is the most abundant component of the viral envelope. It plays an important role in viral assembly process
and budding [10, 11]. The M protein can also induce production of protective antibodies [10, 12]. The N protein of
the coronavirus forms a helical nucleocapsid with genomic
RNA and protects the viral genome from external interference [13, 14].
RNA interference (RNAi) is a process that effectively
silences or inhibits the expression of a gene of interest,
which is achieved by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which

selectively inactivates the mRNA of the target gene. RNAi
has been successfully used in infection inhibition studies
of animal viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
(PEDV) [15], influenza virus A [16], porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [17], and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [18]. However,
whether RNAi inhibits the replication of PDCoV has not
been reported.
RNAi interferes with viral replication through short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).
shRNA is more stable, long-lasting, and more efficient than
siRNA. Therefore, in this study, we constructed two shRNAs
(pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N) in a plasmid expression system that targeted the M and N genes of PDCoV, and investigated the efficiency of shRNA-mediated RNAi of PDCoV
replication in vitro.

siRNA​). Using the BLAST program, the candidate shRNA
sequences were aligned with the pig genome and other
PDCoV sequences submitted to GenBank, and the specific
strong shRNAs were selected. To ensure a similar RNAi
effect on different PDCoV strains, two theoretically effective
sequences at nucleotide positions 328–346 (M) and 270–288
(N) were selected. dsDNA sequences encoding the shRNAs
were synthesized, with 4-nt 5′ single-stranded overhangs
complementary to BamHI and HindIII-cleaved DNA at the
ends. Scrambled siRNA sequences were designed as negative controls (NC). The sequences are shown in Table 1.
Each ds-shRNA-coding sequence was ligated into the
BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of the shRNA expression vector pGenesil-1 (Wuhan Genesil Biotechnology,
China) and transformed into Escherichia coli competent
cells. The recombinant plasmids were named pGenesil-M,
pGenesil-N, and pGenesil-NC.

Materials and methods

Transfection of shRNA plasmids and virus infection

Cell culture, virus propagation, and titration

ST cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at 2 × 105 per well
in 500 μL medium without antibiotics in a conventional
manner and cultured for 18–24 h at 37 °C in a 5% ­CO 2
environment. When the degree of monolayer cell confluence reached 70–80%, transfection was started according to the manufacturer’s instructions of LipoGene™
2000 plus transfection reagent (US Everbright lnc., San
Francisco, US). Briefly, 2 μg of transfection reagent was
diluted with 50 μL of Opti-MEM and stand for 5 min at
room temperature, then mixed with 50 μL diluted shRNAexpressing plasmid (1 μg shRNA-expressing plasmid was
diluted with 50 μL of Opti-MEM). After 20 min, the cells
of each well were washed three times and overlaid with
100 μL of the transfection mixture. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and the medium was changed. After
24 h, the cells were infected with 100 ­TCID50 PDCoV. ST
cells infected with PDCoV but had undergone the transfection procedure without plasmid DNA added served as
mock-transfected controls. Expression vector pGenesil-1
encodes the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).
Therefore, EGFP expression in a cell line can be used as a

ST cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(Zhejiang Tianhang Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Hangzhou,
China) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution, and incubated in a 37 °C environment containing 5% carbon dioxide.
The PDCoV strain HB-BD (GenBank No. MF948005) was
propagated in ST cells as previously described [1]. After
80% of the cells developed a cytopathic effect (CPE) of viral
infection, the culture (cells plus medium) was collected and
subjected to three freeze–thaw cycles to lyse the cells. The
virus titer was determined by the 50% tissue culture infectious dose ­(TCID50) as described previously [6].

In this study, we used inverted fluorescence microscopy to
capture images to evaluate the cell transfection efficiency
and CPE.

Assay and determination of ­TCID50
PDCoV cultures in shRNA expression plasmid-transfected
ST cells were harvested 48 h after virus infection. After
three repeated freeze–thaw cycles, the virus was diluted
from ­1 0 −1 to ­1 0 −10 and added to a 96-well plate with
eight wells per dilution of virus. CPE was observed and
recorded daily, and viral titer was measured by T
­ CID50
using the Reed–Muench method as previously described
[1, 6].

Analysis of RNA levels by real‑time quantitative
RT‑PCR
N gene of PDCoV was used as a standard to assess the
inhibitory effect of shRNA on viral replication. Total
RNA was extracted from shRNA expression plasmids
-transfected ST cells after 48 h of infection, and reverse
transcription was performed using the PrimeScript™
1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) analysis was performed to amplify N gene using
the cDNA as the template and the β-actin cDNA as the
internal standard. The primers used are shown in Table 2.
The quantitative RT-PCR contained 7.5 μL SYBR Mixture
(CWBIO, Beijing, China), 0.5 μL (10 μM) forward primer,
0.5μL (10 μM) reverse primer, 1.5 μL cDNA template, and
10 μL RNase-free deionized distilled water. The reaction
protocol was as follows: 95 °C for 600 s, followed by 40
cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s; the melting
curve stage comprised 95 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 60 s, and
97 °C for 1 s, as well as 37 °C for 30 s. Each experiment
was repeated three times. The relative number of viral
RNA copies in cells interfered with different plasmids was
calculated by the ­2−ΔΔCt method.

Results
Transfection efficiency of shRNA expression
plasmids
ST cells transfected with shRNA recombinant plasmids
(pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N) and a scrambled shRNA
recombinant plasmid (pGenesil-NC) were observed under
fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Normal ST cells showed
no fluorescence, while ST cells transfected with recombinant plasmid showed fluorescence. The shRNA recombinant
plasmids were successfully transfected into ST cells, and the
transfection efficiency of the two recombinant plasmids and
the scrambled shRNA plasmid was similar.

Examination of shRNA effects by CPE analysis
To analyze whether shRNA can prevent ST cells from exhibiting CPE due to PDCoV infection, recombinant plasmids
pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N were transfected into ST cells
seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates. The vector pGenesilNC expressing the non-specific shRNA was used as a negative control. At 24 h after transfection, cells were infected
with PDCoV at 100 ­TCID50, and cells were examined for
CPE every day. CPE was observed 48 h after infection and
photographed (Fig. 2). ST cells infected with virus only or
ST cells transfected with a negative control plasmid (pGenesil-NC) became enlarged, round, dense granular cells, occurring individually or in clusters. We also observed signs of
cell shrinkage and detachment from the monolayer. As for
the cells transfected with plasmids pGenesil-N and pGenesil-M expressing specific shRNAs, observation showed that
the extent of CPE was reduced.

Examination of shRNA effects on PDCoV replication
by ­TCID50 assay
To analyze the inhibition of PDCoV replication by
shRNA, viral titers in ST cells were calculated by the
Reed–Muench method at 48 h after viral infection (Fig. 3).
The results showed that the titers of PDCoV were 1­ 04.15
and ­103.76 ­TCID50/mL in cells harboring pGenesil-M and
pGenesil-N, respectively. The PDCoV titer was ­1 0 5.35
­T CID 50/mL in cells pre-transfected with pGenesil-NC,
which was similar to the titer of ­1 0 5.27 ­T CID 50/mL in
mock-transfected cells. In comparison with the titers of
virus produced by cells transfected with pGenesil-NC, that
of pGenesil-M- and pGenesil-N-transfected cells corresponded to 13.2- and 32.4-fold reductions, respectively.
The titers of virus produced by cells transfected with the
recombinant plasmids pGenesil-N and pGenesil-M were

that of pGenesil-M shRNA.

normalized to the corresponding β-actin in the same sample (Fig. 4). The relative amount of N gene in mock cells

0.542, 0.439, and 1.079, respectively. Analysis of these
data revealed that the amount of viral RNA in samples

PDCoV is a recently discovered porcine enteropathogenic
coronavirus [8, 19–21]. Since 2015, PDCoV has emerged in
many provinces, leading to significant economic losses in
swine husbandry in China. However, there are presently no
effective treatments or vaccines available to control PDCoV
[6]. So, there is an urgency to develop an effective method
for treatment of PDCoV.
RNAi is a gene silencing mechanism at the post-transcriptional level with high specificity and can inhibit gene
expression with high efficiency. Therefore, RNAi has been
considered as an effective strategy to protect against bacterial and viral pathogens [22, 23]. RNAi is triggered by
endogenous or exogenous 21–23 nt RNA duplexes [17], and
shRNA and siRNA are two commonly used RNA molecules
to block gene expression [17, 24]. Compared with siRNA,
the interference efficiency induced by shRNA was more
effective. Recently, the interference efficiency of shRNA in
some coronaviruses has been studied. Wang designed and
constructed three recombinant plasmids targeting the M
gene of porcine TGEV. After transfection into PK15 cells, M
gene expression was reduced by 13, 68, and 70% [17]. Shen
et al. [15] have constructed five shRNA-expressing plasmids
targeting the N, M, and S genes of PEDV. PEDV RNA in
Vero cells pre-transfected with these plasmids was reduced
by 22–94.5%. However, because the success rate of PDCoV
isolation was low [1, 6, 25], there are no reports on the use
of shRNA to inhibit replication of PDCoV, which belongs
to the same virus family as PEDV and TGEV.
In our previous study, PDCoV strain HB-BD was successfully isolated and serially passaged in cell culture and
characterized. In this study, we designed two shRNAs based
on the theoretically valid sequences of the M and N genes
of PDCoV with nucleotide positions of 328–346 (M) and
270–288 (N), and established three shRNA recombinant
expression plasmids to study whether shRNA-mediated
RNAi inhibited PDCoV replication in vitro. To guarantee
a similar RNAi effect on different PDCoV strains, the two
theoretically effective sequences were analyzed by BLAST
to ensure that they did not have any similar sequences in
the swine genome, but shared 100% similarity with the
published sequences of different PDCoV strains. Both the
shRNAs inhibited PDCoV replication in ST cells. The interference properties were revealed by reductions in CPE formation, virus T
­ CID50 titers, and viral RNA copy numbers in
the infected cells. The CPE and T
­ CID50 assay of pGenesilM- and pGenesil-N-transfected cells showed viral suppression 48 h after infection and the titers of pGenesil-M- and

13

800

pGenesil-N-transfected cells were reduced 13.2- and 32.4fold, respectively. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay
showed that the viral RNA copy number was reduced by
45.8% in pGenesil-M-transfected cells and 56.1% in pGenesil-M-transfected cells. The inhibitory efficiency of pGenesil-N was higher than that of pGenesil-M. Although the
interference efficiency of shRNAs against PDCoV in our
study was lower than that of the shRNAs targeting other coronaviruses [15, 17], these results indicate that RNAi against
PDCoV mediated by shRNAs can inhibit PDCoV replication
in vitro. A disadvantage of this transient transfection/expression system is that virus replication can be inhibited only in
cells that are expressing the shRNA, and cells not expressing
the shRNA can be infected. Therefore, one explanation for
the lower interference efficiency of shRNAs against PDCoV
in this study compared to shRNAs targeting other coronaviruses in other studies could be lower transfection efficiency
of the shRNA expression plasmids.
In conclusion, our results indicate that both shRNAs plasmids targeting the M (328–346) and N (210–288) genes of
PDCoV genome inhibit PDCoV replication in ST cells with
high efficiency. Therefore, the two nucleotide positions are
two potential targets for the inhibition of PDCoV replication
by RNAi in vitro. However, whether the two shRNAs can
inhibit PDCoV replication in vivo, and whether shRNAs
targeting other nucleotide positions of the M and N genes
or other genes also inhibit PDCoV replication need further
research.
