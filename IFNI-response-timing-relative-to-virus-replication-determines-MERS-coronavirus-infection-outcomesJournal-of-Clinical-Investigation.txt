Type 1 IFNs (IFN-I) generally protect mammalian hosts from virus infections, but in some cases, IFN-I is pathogenic. Because
IFN-I is protective, it is commonly used to treat virus infections for which no specific approved drug or vaccine is available.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is such an infection, yet little is known about the role of IFN-I
in this setting. Here, we show that IFN-I signaling is protective during MERS-CoV infection. Blocking IFN-I signaling resulted
in delayed virus clearance, enhanced neutrophil infiltration, and impaired MERS-CoV–specific T cell responses. Notably,
IFN-I administration within 1 day after infection (before virus titers peak) protected mice from lethal infection, despite a
decrease in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) and inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In contrast, delayed IFN-β treatment
failed to effectively inhibit virus replication; increased infiltration and activation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils
in the lungs; and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression, resulting in fatal pneumonia in an otherwise sublethal
infection. Together, these results suggest that the relative timing of the IFN-I response and maximal virus replication is key in
determining outcomes, at least in infected mice. By extension, IFN-αβ or combination therapy may need to be used cautiously
to treat viral infections in clinical settings.

Introduction

Emerging and reemerging highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses
are a significant threat to global public health (1–3). This threat
is illustrated by the appearance of several highly pathogenic
respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome–
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome–CoV
(MERS-CoV), and pathogenic strains of influenza viruses (1, 3).
MERS-CoV is a novel human CoV that emerged in 2012 in the
Middle East and has since spread to 27 countries, with the majority of cases recorded in the Middle East and South Korea (4, 5).
Since its identification, MERS-CoV has infected 2374 individuals
and caused 823 deaths (as of February 28, 2019) (6). MERS-CoV
continues to infect human populations in the Middle East and as
a result remains a public health threat. Additionally, isolation of
MERS-CoV from camels and identification of SARS- and MERSlike CoVs in bats make it likely that these viruses will continue to
emerge and cause additional outbreaks (7, 8). Despite the high
morbidity and mortality rates associated with MERS, the limited
number of autopsy studies has hindered our understanding of
MERS in humans. Additionally, MERS-CoV causes mild to moderate disease in nonhuman primates and other nonhuman hosts,

making it challenging to study MERS pathogenesis (9). Among
several animal models used to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis,
we and others have shown that infection of human dipeptidyl
peptidase 4–knockin (hDPP4-KI) mice with a mouse-adapted
strain of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA) replicates several features
of MERS in humans (10, 11).
While pathogenic human CoVs (hCoVs) are known to cause
severe pneumonia, the mechanistic basis of their high morbidity and mortality is incompletely understood. Rapid virus replication reaching high titers and associated enhanced inflammatory responses are believed to contribute to severe pneumonia
(12–14). The innate antiviral response, particularly production
of IFN-I (IFN-α and IFN-β), constitutes the first line of defense
against multiple virus infections. IFN-I mediates antiviral effects
by directly inhibiting virus replication and indirectly modulating the host immune response to virus infection, both of which
are mediated by induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (15,
16). Because of its antiviral effects, IFN-I has been used in trials
in combination with other antiviral agents to prevent and treat
emerging and reemerging virus infections for which no approved
drugs are available (17–20). However, results from these trials
have yielded inconsistent results. In addition, other studies indicated that IFN-I has pathogenic effects during acute and chronic
infections (14, 21–24). Together, these findings suggest that the
relationship between virus replication and or related pathogenesis and the kinetics of IFN expression, whether endogenous or
after exogenous administration, contributed to the variability

of outcomes. IFN-I therapy has been used to treat patients with
severe respiratory disease caused by CoVs, with similarly inconsistent outcomes (25). In particular, IFN-I treatment of patients
with MERS failed to improve survival (17, 26, 27). For example, in
one study, IFN treatment prolonged survival when assessed at 14
days, but not at 28 days (17).
Here, we used a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection to
investigate the mechanistic basis for the protective and pathogenic effects of early and delayed IFN responses, respectively,
during viral pneumonia. We show that, unlike in SARS-CoV–
infected mice, IFN-I signaling is protective during MERS-CoV
infection and is specifically required for virus clearance. Early
exogenous administration of recombinant IFN-β (rIFN-β) completely protected mice from lethal MERS-CoV infection by
inhibiting virus replication and inflammatory cytokine production. Conversely, delayed rIFN-β therapy caused a striking
increase in IFN, ISG, and inflammatory cytokine levels, resulting
in fatal disease in an otherwise sublethal infection. These results
demonstrate that the timing of IFN-αβ receptor (IFNAR) signaling relative to peak virus replication is a critical determinant of
protective and pathogenic immunity and may help explain the
disparate results obtained in clinical trials.

Results

IFN-I signaling is essential for host protection during MERS-CoV
infection. To investigate whether the absence of clinical disease in
hDPP4-KI mice infected with 1 × 105 PFU of a human isolate of
MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center/2012 [EMC/2012]) strain)
was dependent on IFN-I signaling, we treated infected hDPP4KI mice with control or anti-IFNAR (α-IFNAR) antibody. Neither
α-IFNAR–treated nor control mice lost weight, and there were no
differences in survival (Figure 1A). However, α-IFNAR–treated
mice had a significantly higher viral load 5 days postinfection (dpi)
compared with control mice (Figure 1B). We next infected control
and α-IFNAR–treated mice with an LD50 dose of MERS-CoV-MA
(500 PFU). Although we observed a 60% mortality rate in the

RESEARCH ARTICLE

control mice, 100% of the α-IFNAR–treated mice succumbed to
MERS-CoV-MA infection (Figure 1C). Further, following infection with a sublethal (200–250 PFU) dose of MERS-CoV-MA, the
α-IFNAR–treated mice lost more weight than did the control mice
(>25%) and had reduced survival rates (Figure 1, D and E). Lung
virus titers and viral genomic RNA (gRNA) levels were similar
in both groups of mice at 2 dpi (Figure 1, F and G). However, at
both 4 dpi and 7 dpi, we observed higher virus titers in the lungs of
α-IFNAR–treated mice compared with titers in control mice (Figure 1, F and G). To assess whether delayed virus clearance resulted
in an extrapulmonary spread, we measured virus titers in other
organs. We did not detect MERS-CoV-MA in heart, liver, spleen,
or kidney tissue (Figure 1H), suggesting that even in the absence
of IFN-I signaling, MERS-CoV infection is limited to the lungs in
hDPP4-KI mice. We also performed lung histology studies and
observed enhanced neutrophil infiltration and cellular hyperplasia in α-IFNAR–treated mice compared with control mice (Figure
1, I and J). However, because the kinetics of disease progression
overlapped between the control and α-IFNAR–treated mice, only
the difference in the numbers of neutrophils reached statistical
significance. Together, these results suggest that IFN-I signaling
is required for virus clearance and host protection during MERSCoV infection.
TLR-7 is the primary sensor of MERS-CoV RNA in airway epithelial cells. A delayed IFN-I response relative to peak lung virus
titers correlated with severe disease in a mouse model of SARS
(14). Consequently, we next compared the kinetics of the IFN
response and MERS-CoV-MA replication in hDPP4-KI mice.
Unlike in SARS-CoV–infected mice (14), we observed simultaneous peaks of MERS-CoV-MA replication and IFN (IFN-αβ and
IFN-λ) responses in the lungs of hDPP4-Ki mice (Figure 2A),
implying that both early and simultaneous IFN responses protect
the host from virus infection. Next, we examined innate sensors
essential for MERS-CoV RNA detection and IFN induction. Previous studies using mouse CoVs showed that TLR7/MyD88 and
MDA5/MAVS pathways are critical mediators of CoV RNA sensing and IFN induction in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and bone
marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs), respectively (28, 29).
Since pattern recognition receptor (PRR) expression varies with
the cell type (30, 31) and hCoVs mainly infect airway epithelial
cells (13, 32–35), we examined whether one or both of these pathways are essential for IFN induction in epithelial cells. To do
this, we transduced WT C57BL/6 (B6) and MAVS –/– B6, and WT
BALB/c and TLR7–/– BALB/c mice with adenovirus 5–expressing
human DPP4 (Ad5-hDPP4), as previously described (36). Ad5hDPP4 transduces the majority of airway and alveolar epithelial
cells, and most of these Ad5-hDPP4–transduced cells are subsequently infected with MERS-CoV-EMC (36). Additionally, Ad5hDPP4–transduced B6 and BALB/c mice show similar disease
following MERS-CoV-EMC infection (36). Since hDPP4-KI mice
with deletion of MAVS or TLR7 are not available, and since only
transduced cells are infected with MERS-CoV (36), we used Ad5hDPP4–transduced B6, BALB/c, MAVS –/–, and TLR7–/– mice to
study sensors required for IFN induction. In addition, intranasally
(i.n.) administered Ad5 efficiently transduces epithelial cells
(37), allowing us to investigate viral RNA sensing specifically
in epithelial cells (36). Six days after transduction, we infected

WT and KO mice with MERS-CoV-EMC virus and measured
lung IFN transcript levels at 1 and 2 dpi (Figure 2B). We found
significantly reduced IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ expression in
the lungs of TLR7–/– mice compared with expression levels in
BALB/c mice (Figure 2C). In contrast, IFN levels were similar
or even elevated in MAVS –/– mice compared with levels in B6
mice (Figure 2D). Like MERS-CoV infection, SARS-CoV predominantly infects lung epithelial cells and abortively infects
hematopoietic cells (13, 38, 39). We therefore infected TLR7–/–
and MAVS –/– mice and their respective WT controls with a
mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (MA15) as another approach
to determine the relevant virus-sensing molecule. Infection with
MA15 showed that signaling of both TLR7 and MAVS was essential for IFN induction in the lungs, as demonstrated by reduced
IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ mRNA levels in the lungs from TLR7–/–
and MAVS –/– mice compared with lungs from WT controls (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B). These results indicate that TLR7/
MyD88 signaling is an important mediator of the IFN response in
lung epithelial cells during MERS-CoV infection but that MAVS
signaling, based on the results following SARS-CoV infection, is
important after infection of nonepithelial cells.

Blocking IFN-I signaling modulates inflammatory monocytes
and macrophages and neutrophil responses to MERS-CoV infection.
Severe disease in hCoV infection is generally characterized by an
excessive innate immune response. In particular, a robust infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages (IMMs)
(CD45+CD11b+Ly6Chi) occurs in severe SARS, contributing to
mortality (34, 40, 41). Since IMM migration is IFN dependent,
we next measured immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory
cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels in the lungs of control and
α-IFNAR–treated hDPP4-KI mice. As expected, there was a significant reduction in the total number of IMMs in the lungs of
α-IFNAR–treated mice at 2 and 4 dpi compared with controls (Figure 3, A and B). In contrast, although there was no difference in the
total number of neutrophils (CD45+CD11b+Ly6Ghi) in the lungs 2
and 4 dpi between groups, α-IFNAR–treated mice had higher
numbers of neutrophils by 7 dpi compared with control mice (Figure 3, C and D). Further, neutrophils in the lungs of α-IFNAR–
treated mice produced significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well as increased levels
of iNOS compared with control mice (Supplemental Figure 2B).

(AMs), conventional DCs, and NK cells. Although AM numbers
were similar in control and α-IFNAR mice early after infection,
we found that they were increased in α-IFNAR–treated mice by

day 7 dpi (Supplemental Figure 2A). Total DC and NK cell numbers in the lungs were lower in α-IFNAR–treated mice at 2 and 4
dpi, respectively (Supplemental Figure 2A), suggesting an effect of
IFN-I signaling on the accumulation of these cells.

Furthermore, lungs from α-IFNAR–treated mice had significantly lower transcript levels of IFN-λ, ISGs (ISG-15 and CXCL10), and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF, IL-6,
CCL-2) at early time points (2 dpi, and in some cases, 4 dpi)
compared with controls (Figure 3, E and F). Levels of CXCL-1,
a neutrophil chemoattractant, were significantly increased on 4
dpi in α-IFNAR–treated mice, thereby preceding the increased
neutrophil accumulation detected by histology and flow cytometric analysis at 7 dpi. (Figure 1I and Figure 3, C and D). In
contrast, mRNA levels of IFN-β and IFN-λ and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were significantly higher by 7
dpi in α-IFNAR–treated mice compared with levels in control
mice (Figure 3, E and F), possibly due to a higher virus burden
(Figure 1, F and G) and the accumulation of highly activated
neutrophils (Supplemental Figure 2B). Further, blocking IFN-I
signaling led to reduced numbers of MERS-CoV–specific CD4+
and CD8+ T cells in the lungs (Figure 3G). To ascertain their role
in MERS-CoV infection, we depleted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
using a combined α-CD4 and α-CD8 antibody. As shown in Figure 3H, depletion of T cells impaired MERS-CoV clearance from
the lungs in comparison with control antibody treatment, suggesting that the reduction in virus-specific T cells contributed
to delayed virus clearance in α-IFNAR–treated mice (Figure
1, F and G). Collectively, these results indicate that blocking

lation, alters cytokine and chemokine responses, and impairs
virus-specific T cell responses.
IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells is essential for virus clearance and host protection. IFN-I signaling in epithelial cells, hematopoietic cells, or both could be required for protection from a viral
infection (42, 43). Notably, infection of BM-derived cells from
hDPP4-KI mice with MERS-CoV failed to produce infectious
virus (Supplemental Figure 3). To examine the role of hematopoietic IFNAR signaling in MERS, we created BM chimeric mice as
described previously (14). Briefly, BM from B6-Ly5.1, hDPP4-KI,
or IFNAR–/– donor mice was adoptively transferred into hDPP4-KI,
B6-Ly5.1, or IFNAR−/− recipient mice, and chimeras were infected
with a sublethal dose of MERS-CoV-MA. As expected, B6-Ly5.1
→ B6-Ly5.1 → IFNAR–/– → B6-Ly5.1 mice did not develop MERS,
because they lacked hDPP4 expression. Although MERS-CoVMA–challenged hDPP4-KI → hDPP4-KI mice lost more weight
than did B6-Ly5.1 → hDPP4-KI mice, their survival was similar
following infection (Figure 4A). However, the lack of IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells in IFNAR–/– → hDPP4-KI mice significantly decreased survival compared with hDPP4-KI mice that
received hDPP4-KI or B6-Ly5.1 BM (Figure 4A). Further, although
MERS-CoV gRNA levels were similar in hDPP4-KI hDPP4-KI and
IFNAR–/– → hDPP4-KI mice at 2 dpi, we observed a 4- to 5-fold
increase in MERS-CoV RNA levels in IFNAR–/– → hDPP4-KI
lungs compared with levels in hDPP4-KI → hDPP4-KI lungs at 6

other inflammatory cytokines in the chimeric mice. We found that
loss of IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells caused reduced transcript levels of IFN-α and IFN-β, IFN-λ, and ISG-15 in the lungs at 2
dpi and increased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcript levels at 2 dpi (TNF) and 6 dpi (IL-6 and CXCL-1) (Figure
4, C and D). These data suggest that IFNAR signaling in hematopoietic cells is essential for virus clearance and protection against
mortality following MERS-CoV infection.
Early treatment with rIFN-β provides complete protection from
lethal MERS-CoV infection. Results shown in this study, in conjunction with those of previous studies (14), indicate that the timing of the peak IFN response determines disease outcome. To further investigate the relationship of IFN timing to disease outcome

during respiratory virus infection, we treated lethally infected
(750 PFU MERS-CoV-MA) hDPP4-KI mice with 750 U rIFN-β
or PBS at either 6 hours p.i. (hpi) or 1 dpi (Figure 5A). These time
points are before peak virus replication occurs, and the rIFN-β
dose is approximately equivalent to that used in humans (44,
45). As expected, all PBS-treated mice succumbed to infection,
whereas mice treated with rIFN-β at either 6 hpi or 1 dpi were
protected from lethal MERS (Figure 5B). rIFN-β treatment significantly reduced MERS-CoV-MA gRNA expression in the lungs at
2 and 4 dpi (Figure 5C). Surprisingly, the expression of ISGs was
downregulated by 4 dpi in the rIFN-β–treated group compared
with expression in the PBS control group (Figure 5D). Likewise, we
detected reduced levels of TNF and CCL-2 at 4 dpi in the rIFN-β–
treated group compared with levels in the control mice (Figure

IMMs and the number of neutrophils at 4 dpi but not at 2 or 6 dpi
(Figure 5, F and H). Moreover, IMMs and neutrophils in the lungs

of rIFN-β–treated mice at 4 dpi were less activated, as shown by

iting virus replication and suppressing deleterious inflammatory
responses to MERS-CoV infection.
Delayed IFN therapy is detrimental to the host during MERSCoV infection. We next evaluated the effect of delayed rIFN-β
therapy (relative to peak virus replication) on MERS pathogenesis. We infected hDPP4-KI mice with a sublethal dose of MERSCoV-MA and subsequently treated them with PBS or rIFN-β at
2 or 4 dpi (Figure 6A). Mice treated with rIFN-β at 2 and 4 dpi
showed increased weight loss and reduced survival compared
with PBS-treated mice, even when the treatment began as early as
2 dpi (Figure 6B), confirming that delayed IFNAR signaling is in
fact detrimental. Further, delayed rIFN-β treatment caused lethal
disease in mice sublethally infected with SARS-CoV (Supplemental Figure 4A), indicating that the lethal effects of delayed IFN-I
signaling are not pathogen specific. In contrast to the effects of
early rIFN-β administration (Figure 5C), mice treated with rIFN-β
at 2 dpi showed only a 3- to 4-fold reduction in viral RNA levels
at 3 dpi, but the levels were similar or trended higher at 5 and 7
dpi compared with levels in PBS-treated mice (Figure 6C). Additionally, rIFN-β administration at 2 dpi resulted in significantly
higher levels of ISG and inflammatory cytokine mRNA (ISG-15,
CXCL-10, CCL-2, and TNF) at 5 dpi compared with levels in PBS
controls (Figure 6, D and E). Furthermore, we detected increased
frequencies and total numbers of IMMs and neutrophils in the
lungs of rIFN-β–treated animals at 5 and 7 dpi (Figure 6, F and
H). Additionally, IMMs and neutrophils in the lungs of rIFN-β–
treated mice were highly activated, as shown by increased CD80
expression and/or the numbers of TNF+ IMMs and neutrophils
after TLR4 or TLR7 stimulation (Figure 6, G and I). We also
observed reduced virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers
in the lungs of mice treated with rIFN-β at 2 dpi compared with
controls and rIFN-β treatment at 1 dpi (Supplemental Figure 4B).
To examine whether IMMs cause lung pathology in mice treated
with rIFN-β at 2 dpi, we depleted IMMs using α-CCR2 antibody
at 2 and 4 dpi. Mice with IMM depletion were protected from
mortality compared with mice that received a control antibody
(Figure 6J), demonstrating a causal role for IMMs in lethality following delayed rIFN-β therapy. These results, together with our
previous study (14), suggest that delayed IFN-I signaling or late
treatment with rIFN-β fails to effectively control virus replication
and is detrimental to the host during MERS-CoV infection. Furthermore, these findings suggest that IFN-mediated recruitment
of IMMs to the lungs contributes to lethality.
Differential gene expression profiles in the lungs following early
and late IFN treatment. To identify additional effects of early versus delayed IFN therapy during MERS-CoV infection, we performed RNA-Seq–based transcriptional profiling to study changes
in global gene expression in the lungs of infected mice treated with
early (1 dpi) or delayed (2 dpi) rIFN-β. A total of 415 genes were
differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001; log2 fold change
>1.5) in the lungs of mice that received early rIFN-β treatment
compared with PBS controls (Figure 7A). Notably, the expression
levels of genes involved in viral nucleic acid sensing, ISGs, IFNrelated transcription factors, and several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were markedly lower in the group that
received early rIFN-β treatment (Figure 7, B and C). Consistent
with this observation, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed
3634

The Journal of Clinical Investigation  
that PRRs, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) activation by cytosolic
receptors, and IFN signaling were all decreased in the group that
received early rIFN-β treatment (Figure 7D). Fewer genes were
upregulated in the lungs treated early with rIFN-β, but these
included genes related to SOCS1, prostaglandin E2 receptor,
sirtuin1, and Irgm1 signaling pathways.
We observed a different set of changes in gene expression
profiles when control mice and mice that received late rIFN-β
treatment were compared. A total of 77 genes were differentially
expressed (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001; log2 fold change >1.5) in the
lungs of mice that received delayed rIFN-β treatment compared
with PBS control lungs (Figure 7, E and G), and these genes were
different than those identified in early rIFN-β treatment, with
an overlap of only 11 genes. We observed increased expression
of TLR4 and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines
(CXCL-14) in mice that received delayed rIFN-β treatment (Figure 7F). Moreover, IPA revealed an upregulation in the expression of genes involved in complement activation and coagulation
(Thbs1 and Serpine1), macrophage activation, and inflammatory
pathways in mice with delayed rIFN-β treatment (Figure 7F and
Supplemental Table 1). Collectively, these results demonstrate
that early and delayed rIFN-β treatment induces distinct gene
expression profiles in mice infected with MERS-CoV. Although
early rIFN-β treatment blunted antiviral and inflammatory gene
expression, delayed rIFN-β treatment increased the expression of
a subset of genes associated with inflammation.

Discussion

Using a mouse model of MERS, we show that the IFN-I response
is crucial for host protection and virus clearance. IFN-I is critical for optimal kinetics of virus clearance and has no effect on
maximal titers reached in the lungs (Figure 1, B, F, and G). IFN-I
expression and peak MERS-CoV replication occurred simultaneously, resulting in protective T cell responses in infected lungs.
Consistent with this, early IFN-I administration was protective.
Conversely, late administration of exogenous IFN-I promoted
lethality via recruitment of activated IMMs and neutrophils, augmentation of the proinflammatory cytokine response, and inhibition of an optimal virus-specific T cell response. Similar results
were observed in MERS patients, for whom severe disease correlated with increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes
and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-I
(46, 47). These results contrast with those obtained in SARSCoV–infected mice, in which the endogenous IFN-I response was
deleterious, such that survival was improved in its absence (14),
and in which peak IFN-I expression lagged behind peak virus replication. Together, these data suggest that the timing of the IFN-I
response relative to the kinetics of virus replication is critical in
determining disease outcomes.
Delayed virus clearance in α-IFNAR–treated mice after
MERS-CoV infection was probably a consequence of impaired
MERS-CoV–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, which
were diminished in the absence of IFN-I signaling (Supplemental
Figure 2). These results are consistent with those of other studies
demonstrating that an optimal IFN-I response is required for the
emergence of a protective T cell response (48, 49). Like previous
studies of SARS-CoV–infected mice and of other virus pathogens

The Journal of Clinical Investigation  
(50, 51), our results confirm an indispensable role for T cells in
virus clearance during MERS-CoV infection. A previous study
showed that neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells individually were
required for virus clearance in MERS-CoV–infected mice (52);
however, our results show that depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells results in suboptimal virus clearance, suggesting some
degree of redundancy. Of note, the reduced numbers of IMMs
and increased neutrophil infiltration in α-IFNAR mice (Figure
3, A and B) may be due to altered IMM and neutrophil chemokine production in the absence of IFN-I signaling (53). Further,
the enhanced proinflammatory activity of neutrophils (Supplemental Figure 2B) probably contributed to the increase in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the lungs of
α-IFNAR mice (Figure 3, E and F). Although other recent studies
have demonstrated similar increases in neutrophil infiltration
(53), the differential regulation of neutrophil proinflammatory
activity by IFN-I signaling is relatively unexplored. Collectively,
these results suggest that a higher virus burden associated with
increased accumulation of inflammatory neutrophils leads to
fatal pneumonia in α-IFNAR–treated mice.
MERS-CoV replicates poorly but induces strong proinflammatory responses in activated human BM–derived cells (54, 55)
and replicates in activated human T cells (56). However, our studies show that MERS-CoV failed to replicate in hDPP4-KI BM–
derived cells (Supplemental Figure 3). Despite these results, our
chimera studies demonstrate a protective role for IFNAR signaling
in hematopoietic cells. Reduced transcript levels of IFN and ISG
in the lungs of hDPP4 mice that received IFNAR–/– BM (Figure 4C)
suggest that IFN and ISG were induced via a feedback amplification of IFNAR signaling in hematopoietic cells (Figure 4, C and D)
and subsequently played an essential role in IFN and ISG induction and host protection upon MERS-CoV infection. Parenthetically, although it is not known which hematopoietic cell type, if
any, is the dominant source of IFN during MERS-CoV infection,
MERS studies in human cells (57) and studies of SARS-CoV in
both human hematopoietic cells and mouse models (14, 42) suggest that pDCs, and possibly macrophages, are the sources of IFN
in infected mice.
Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for MDA5 in
sensing CoV RNA and thereby initiating the IFN-I response (29).
The majority of these studies used macrophages infected with a
murine CoV, mouse hepatitis virus, which is macrophage tropic
(58, 59). Since human CoVs predominantly infect airway and
alveolar epithelial cells and PRR expression is cell-type specific,
we examined the PRRs necessary for IFN production specifically
in airway and alveolar epithelial cells using mice transduced with
Ad5-hDPP4 and then infected with the human EMC/2012 strain
of MERS-CoV. Ad5 predominantly infects epithelial cells and not
myeloid cells (37). Results from these studies showed that TLR7/
MyD88 but not MAVS signaling was required for IFN production
after infection of lung epithelial cells (Figure 2, A and B). As noted
previously, human pDCs are the predominant hematopoietic cell
source of IFN-I after MERS-CoV infection (57), and signaling
occurs through TLR7. Whether infected epithelial cells or uninfected (bystander) pDCs are most important for TLR7-dependent
IFN-I expression in Ad5-hDPP4–transduced cells will require further investigation. These results are similar to those of previous

RESEARCH ARTICLE

studies that showed more severe clinical disease and slower kinetics of virus clearance in IFNAR–/– and Myd88–/– mice compared with
WT and MAVS –/– mice after Ad5-hDPP4 transduction and MERSCoV infection (36). These data, in conjunction with other findings,
demonstrate that RNA sensing by PRRs is virus specific, as MAVS
alone or both MyD88 and MAVS together were essential for IFN
and ISG induction in mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) or influenza A virus (IAV), respectively (60, 61). Additionally, it is likely that immune-evasive mechanisms, such as MERSCoV 4a protein–mediated inhibition of PACT (a dsRNA-binding
protein that activates RIG and MDA5), impair MDA5-mediated
IFN-I responses (62).
Early rIFN-β therapy dramatically reduced viral gRNA levels
in the lungs without an increase in ISG expression after rIFN-β
treatment (2 and 6 dpi) (Figures 5 and 7). This result was unexpected, because the antiviral effects of IFN-Is are primarily mediated by ISGs, which reduce virus burden through a variety of
mechanisms (15). Instead, we detected substantial decreases in
ISG and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the
lungs at 4 dpi (day 3 after IFN therapy). These decreases in ISGs
and inflammatory cytokine expression were not due to reduced
viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), as the
levels of these mediators were similar at 2 and 6 dpi, despite a
reduction in viral gRNA levels (Figure 5C). Our results suggest
that early IFN treatment suppresses inflammatory cytokine and
chemokine expression, thereby dampening the accumulation and
function of inflammatory cells, notably IMMs and neutrophils, in
the lungs. These results also reveal an antiinflammatory immuno­
modulatory role for IFN early during acute virus infection. In
complete contrast to the early IFN treatment results, delayed IFN
treatment resulted in a robust proinflammatory response and did
not improve virus clearance (Figure 6, D–I). Notably, we detected
upregulation of genes involved in coagulation molecules, which
were shown to contribute to severe disease in SARS-CoV–infected
mice (63). Ineffective control of virus replication is likely due to
IFN and ISG antagonism by viral proteins, and/or the result of
impaired virus-specific T cell responses (14, 64). Although further
studies are required to determine whether delayed IFN-I signaling is pathogenic during other viral lung infections, the increased
disease severity observed in IAV-infected mice receiving prolonged rIFN-α treatment supports the idea that this signaling has
deleterious effects (65).
Furthermore, the exaggerated inflammatory responses
observed in delayed rIFN-β–treated mice underscore the importance of early IFN therapy during acute virus infection. As in
our studies, prophylactic or early therapeutic administration of
IFNs during MERS-CoV infection in rhesus macaques provided
significant protection (66). However, studies in humans failed to
conclusively establish the beneficial effects of rIFN therapy (17,
26, 27, 67), possibly because of delayed administration relative
to peak virus titers. Our results and these clinical studies suggest that IFN-I treatment has protective and pathogenic effects
that are dependent on the timing of administration relative to
infection. We attempted to demonstrate this directly by treating MERS-CoV–infected human airway cells with human IFN-I
at different time points after infection and assaying for levels of
proinflammatory cytokines and virus titers. However, our results

RESEARCH ARTICLE

were not consistent, as relative levels of virus and proinflammatory cytokines varied between experiments. This variability
in expression of inflammatory mediators most likely occurred
because IFN-I administered to an experimentally infected animal
or patient functions in the complex inflammatory milieu of the
lung and acts on both infected and bystander cells. MERS-CoV
infection of human airway cells in isolation does not adequately
reflect this complexity.
In summary, our results demonstrate a critical role for IFN-I
in facilitating virus clearance and host survival during MERS-CoV.
Additionally, our results suggest that a delayed IFN response contributes to severe viral lung infections, and as a result, understanding the kinetics of MERS-CoV replication will be critical for developing rational therapeutic approaches. It will also be important to
develop assays that provide information about the virological and
inflammatory status of specific patients to enable appropriate use
of IFN and other therapies. Since the timing of the IFN-I response
relative to virus replication is critical in determining disease outcome, IFN or combination therapy should be used cautiously to
treat acute viral infections, since the peak for virus replication is
generally unknown in patients.

Methods
Mice and virus
Specific pathogen–free human DPP4–KI mice were generated as
described earlier (10). Male and female mice, 8–12 weeks of age, were
used for these studies. B6, B6-Ly5.1, and BALB/c mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories. MAVS –/– mice on a B6 background
and TLR7–/– mice on a BALB/c background were a gift from Michael
Gale Jr. (University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA) and
Westley Reeves (University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA,
with permission from Shizuo Akira, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan),
respectively. TLR7–/– mice were re-derived by crossing them with
Charles River BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories). Mice were
bred and maintained at the University of Iowa animal care facility. The
MERS-CoV-MA15 strain was generated as described earlier (10). Mice
were anesthetized using xylazine-ketamine and i.n. infected with a
200 to 250 PFU (sublethal), 500 PFU (LD50), or 1000 PFU (lethal)
dose of MERS-CoV-MA in 50 μL DMEM. All work with MERS-CoV
was conducted at the University of Iowa Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) and
animal BSL3 laboratories.
Lung virus titers
To obtain tissues for virus titers, mice were euthanized on different
days after challenge, lungs were removed and homogenized in PBS,
and titers were determined for Vero E81 cells. Cells were fixed with
10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet 3 dpi. Virus titers are
represented as PFU/lung.
Lung histology
Animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 10 mL
PBS followed by 5 mL zinc formalin. Lungs were removed, fixed in zinc
formalin, and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with H&E
and examined by light microscopy in a blinded fashion (68). Control
and α-IFNAR–treated lungs were scored for edema and cell proliferation (e.g., remodeling and repair changes such as fibroplasia and/or
3636

The Journal of Clinical Investigation  
epithelial hyperplasia), with scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 representing lung
areas with 0%, less than 3%, 6%–33%, 33%–66%, and more than 66%
detectable proliferation, respectively. Lungs were also scored for neutrophil infiltration, with scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 representing areas
with 0%, less than 3%, 6%–33%, 33%–66%, and more than 66% of
perivascular polymorphonuclear cell distribution, respectively.

Lung cell preparation for FACS analysis
Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points and perfused via
the right ventricle with 10 mL PBS. Lungs obtained were minced and
digested in HBSS buffer containing 2% FCS, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mg/mL
collagenase D (Roche), and 0.1 mg/mL DNase (Roche) for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Digested tissues were then pressed through a
70-μm cell strainer to remove particulate matter to obtain single-cell
suspensions. Cells were enumerated by 0.2% trypan blue exclusion or
by a Scepter 2.0 cell counter (MilliporeSigma).
Intracellular cytokine staining
For intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), 1 × 106 cells per well were
incubated at 37°C for 6 hours in the presence of 1 μg Golgiplug (BD
Biosciences). T cell ICS was performed after stimulating lung cells
with a 1-μM concentration of specific peptide. MERS-CoV–specific
CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses were identified using peptides corresponding to a previously defined epitope (S1165) (36) and a recently
identified (by our lab) epitope (N99, YFYYTGTGPEAALPF), respectively. Neutrophil ICS was performed by incubating lung cells with
no stimulation at 37°C for 7 hours. IMM ICS was performed on cells
stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL, ) or R837 (TLR7 agonist, 1 μg/mL).
Cells were washed and blocked with 1 μg α-CD16/α-CD32 antibody
and surface stained with the indicated antibodies on ice. Cells were
then fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD
Biosciences) and labeled with an α-cytokine antibody. All flow cytometric data were acquired on a BD FACSVerse (BD Biosciences) and
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Antibodies and rIFN-β
For surface and intracellular staining, cells were incubated with the
following fluorochrome-labeled antibodies specific for mouse antigens: PECy7 α-CD45 (30-F11); FITC α-Ly6G (1A8, BD Biosciences);
PE/PerCp-Cy5.5 α-Ly6C (AL-21 [BD Biosciences] or HK1.4); V450
α-CD11b (M1/70); APC α-F4/80 (BM8); FITC/PE α-CD11c (HL3);
α-CD80 (16-10A1); α-CD4 (RM4-5); α-CD8α (53-6.7); APC α–TNF-α
(MP6-XT22); APC α–IL-6 (MP5-20F3); APC α–IL-β (NJTEN3);
APC α-iNOS (CXNFT, BD Biosciences); and PerCp-Cy5.5 α-IA/IE
(M5/114.15.2) (unless otherwise stated, all from eBioscience). APC/PE
α-CCR2 (475301) was purchased from R&D Systems; PE/APC α–BST2 (JF051C2.4.1) was obtained from Miltenyi Biotec; and APC–MCP-1
(clone 2H5) was purchased from BioLegend. rIFN-β was obtained
from PBL Assay Science (catalog 12405-1). For in vivo studies, 750 U
rIFN-β in PBS was administered i.n. at the indicated time points
In vivo antibody treatments and monocyte and neutrophil depletion
Young, 7- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were treated i.p. with blocking
α-IFNAR monoclonal antibody (clone MAR1-5A3, Bio X Cell) at –6
hours (750 μg) and on day 1 (250 μg). The same concentrations of
mouse IgG1 (clone MOPC21) were used as a control antibody. For
monocyte depletion, α-CCR2 antibody (clone MC21, 25 μg/dose

RESEARCH ARTICLE

The Journal of Clinical Investigation  
in 250 μL PBS, i.p.) (69) was administered at 2 and 4 dpi. A similar
concentration of rat-IgG was used as a control antibody. T cells were
depleted by treating mice with a combination of α-CD4 (clone GK1.5,
250 μg/mouse) and α-CD8 antibody (clone 2.43 250 μg/mouse) on –2,
0, and +2 dpi. Control mice received rat Ig at a similar concentration at
the indicated time points.

Mouse BM chimeras
BM cells were extracted from femurs and tibiae of hDPP4, B6, B6-Ly5.1,
and IFNAR–/– mice (all 6–7 weeks of age) and filtered through a 70-μm
nylon filter, and RBC were lysed using ammonium chloride potassium
(ACK) buffer. Isolated BM cells (1 × 107 cells) were adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated (10 Gy) hDPP4, B6-Ly5.1, or IFNAR−/−
mice. Chimeric mice were maintained on water supplemented with
antibiotics for 4 weeks to prevent opportunistic infections. Reconstitution was verified 5 weeks after BM transfer by FACS analysis of PBMCs.
Six weeks after BM transfer, mice were infected with MERS-CoV (500
PFU) and monitored for weight loss and survival. We used 500 PFU in
these experiments, because BM chimeric mice were relatively resistant
to developing disease when infected with 200 to 250 PFU MERS-CoVMA. Lungs were collected in TRIzol at 2 and 6 dpi to determine viral
RNA levels and mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines.
RNA preparation from lungs and BM cells and chemokine estimation
by quantitative PCR
Total lung RNA extracted from lungs at different time points after
infection using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was
treated with RQ1 RNAse Free DNAse (Promega) for 10 to 15 minutes
at 37°C to remove gDNA contamination. cDNA was synthesized using
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and mRNA levels were determined after normalizing each sample to
HPRT. Specific primer sets used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) were
previously described (70–72). The primer sequences used to examine
MERS-CoV ORF1a gRNA levels were as follows: forward, 5′-CCACTACTCCCATTTCGTCAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGTATGTGTAGTGCGCATATAAGCA-3′.
RNA-Seq and gene expression profiling of lung samples
Total lung RNA extracted from lungs at the indicated time points p.i.
using TRIzol was treated with RQ1 RNAse-Free DNAse for 10 to 15 minutes at 37°C to remove genomic DNA contamination. RNA-Seq analyses were performed at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center.
Sample quality assessment. RNA isolates were quantified using a
fluorimetric RiboGreen assay. Total RNA integrity was assessed using
capillary electrophoresis (e.g., Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100), generating
an RNA integrity number (RIN). For samples to pass the quality control step, sample RNA quantification needed to be higher than 500 ng
and have a RIN of 8 or greater, before they are converted to Illumina
sequencing libraries.
Library creation. Total RNA samples were converted to Illumina
sequencing libraries using Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (catalog RS-122-2103. See https://www.illumina.
com/ for a detailed list of kit contents and methods). In summary, 500
ng total RNA was oligo-dT purified using oligo-dT–coated magnetic
beads, fragmented, and then reverse transcribed into cDNA. The
cDNA was adenylated, ligated to dual-indexed (barcoded) adaptors,
and amplified using 15 cycles of PCR. The final library size distri-

bution was validated using capillary electrophoresis and quantified
using fluorimetry (PicoGreen). Indexed libraries were then normalized and pooled and the size selected to 320 bp ± 5% using the Pippin
HT instrument.
Cluster generation and sequencing. TruSeq libraries (Illumina) were
hybridized to a NextSeq (single read; Illumina). Clustering occurred
on-board, where the bound library molecules were clonally amplified
and sequenced using Illumina’s sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry. NextSeq uses 2-color chemistry to image the clusters. Upon completion of read 1, a 7-bp index read is performed in the case of single
indexed libraries. If dual-indexing was used during library preparation, 2 separate 8- or 10-bp index reads were performed. Finally, clustered library fragments were resynthesized in the reverse direction,
thus producing the template for a paired-end read 2.
Primary analysis and demultiplexing. Base call (.bcl) files for each
cycle of sequencing were generated using Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) software. The base call files and run folders are streamed
to servers maintained at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.
Primary analysis and demultiplexing were performed using Illumina’s
bcl2fastq software, version 2.20. The end result of the bcl2fastq workflow was demultiplexed FASTQ files that were released.
RNA-Seq data analyses. 7-bp FastQ single-end reads (n = 11.7 million per sample) were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.33)
enabled with the optional “-q” option; 3-bp sliding-window trimming
was from the 3′ end requiring minimum Q30. Quality control checks
on raw sequence data for each sample were performed with Babraham
Bioinformatics FastQC (version 0.11.7). Read mapping was performed
with HISAT2 (version 2.1.0) using the mouse UCSC genome (mm10)
as a reference. Gene quantification was done via Subread (feature
Counts, version 1.4.6) for raw read counts. Differentially expressed
genes were identified with the edgeR (negative binomial) feature in
CLCGWB, version 10.1.2 (QIAGEN) using raw read counts. We filtered the generated list on the basis of a minimum 1.5 absolute fold
change and a FDR-corrected P value of less than 0.001. Complete
RNA-Seq data were deposited in the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE131936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131936).

Statistics
Data were analyzed using a 2-tailed Student’s t test. A P value of less
than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical significance for survival studies was calculated using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with
a 95% CI. Results in the graphs are presented as the mean ± SEM.
Study approval
All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC of the University
of Iowa (protocol 6081822).
