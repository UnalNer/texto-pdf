Type 1 IFNs (IFN-I) generally protect mammalian hosts from virus infections, but in some cases, IFN-I is pathogenic. Because
IFN-I is protective, it is commonly used to treat virus infections for which no specific approved drug or vaccine is available.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is such an infection, yet little is known about the role of IFN-I
in this setting. Here, we show that IFN-I signaling is protective during MERS-CoV infection. Blocking IFN-I signaling resulted
in delayed virus clearance, enhanced neutrophil infiltration, and impaired MERS-CoV–specific T cell responses. Notably,
IFN-I administration within 1 day after infection (before virus titers peak) protected mice from lethal infection, despite a
decrease in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) and inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In contrast, delayed IFN-β treatment
failed to effectively inhibit virus replication; increased infiltration and activation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils
in the lungs; and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression, resulting in fatal pneumonia in an otherwise sublethal
infection. Together, these results suggest that the relative timing of the IFN-I response and maximal virus replication is key in
determining outcomes, at least in infected mice. By extension, IFN-αβ or combination therapy may need to be used cautiously
to treat viral infections in clinical settings.

Emerging and reemerging highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses
are a significant threat to global public health (1–3). This threat
is illustrated by the appearance of several highly pathogenic
respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome–
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome–CoV
(MERS-CoV), and pathogenic strains of influenza viruses (1, 3).
MERS-CoV is a novel human CoV that emerged in 2012 in the
Middle East and has since spread to 27 countries, with the majority of cases recorded in the Middle East and South Korea (4, 5).
Since its identification, MERS-CoV has infected 2374 individuals
and caused 823 deaths (as of February 28, 2019) (6). MERS-CoV
continues to infect human populations in the Middle East and as
a result remains a public health threat. Additionally, isolation of
MERS-CoV from camels and identification of SARS- and MERSlike CoVs in bats make it likely that these viruses will continue to
emerge and cause additional outbreaks (7, 8). Despite the high
morbidity and mortality rates associated with MERS, the limited
number of autopsy studies has hindered our understanding of
MERS in humans. Additionally, MERS-CoV causes mild to moderate disease in nonhuman primates and other nonhuman hosts,
making it challenging to study MERS pathogenesis (9). Among
several animal models used to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis,
we and others have shown that infection of human dipeptidyl
peptidase 4–knockin (hDPP4-KI) mice with a mouse-adapted
strain of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA) replicates several features
of MERS in humans (10, 11).
While pathogenic human CoVs (hCoVs) are known to cause
severe pneumonia, the mechanistic basis of their high morbidity and mortality is incompletely understood. Rapid virus replication reaching high titers and associated enhanced inflammatory responses are believed to contribute to severe pneumonia
(12–14). The innate antiviral response, particularly production
of IFN-I (IFN-α and IFN-β), constitutes the first line of defense
against multiple virus infections. IFN-I mediates antiviral effects
by directly inhibiting virus replication and indirectly modulating the host immune response to virus infection, both of which
are mediated by induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (15,
16). Because of its antiviral effects, IFN-I has been used in trials
in combination with other antiviral agents to prevent and treat
emerging and reemerging virus infections for which no approved
drugs are available (17–20). However, results from these trials
have yielded inconsistent results. In addition, other studies indicated that IFN-I has pathogenic effects during acute and chronic
infections (14, 21–24). Together, these findings suggest that the
relationship between virus replication and or related pathogenesis and the kinetics of IFN expression, whether endogenous or
after exogenous administration, contributed to the variability
