Genetic alleles that contribute to enhanced susceptibility or resistance to
viral infections and virally induced diseases have often been first identified
in mice before humans due to the significant advantages of the murine system for genetic studies. Herein we review multiple discoveries that have revealed significant insights into virus-host interactions, all made using genetic
mapping tools in mice. Factors that have been identified include innate and
adaptive immunity genes that contribute to host defense against pathogenic
viruses such as herpes viruses, flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses.
Understanding the genetic mechanisms that affect infectious disease outcomes will aid the development of personalized treatment and preventive
strategies for pathogenic infections.

Host genetics dramatically influence the course of viral infections and virally induced diseases.
The discovery of genetic factors linked to virus susceptibility and/or disease outcome requires the
selection of individuals who exhibit unique responses to infections, such as an unusually rapid or
slow progression of disease, or multiple documented exposures to a virus that result in no disease
phenotype. The study of candidate genes is one strategy that has proven successful for identifying
disease susceptibility loci among such individuals. Another approach is an unbiased one in which
DNA from individuals with opposing phenotypes is subjected to genome-wide association studies
(GWASs) to find a correlation between specific genetic loci and the phenotype under study (1).
GWASs take advantage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that, on average, occur every
300 nucleotides throughout a person’s genome. Once a linkage is identified, a candidate gene
approach is used to test genes in the vicinity of the critical SNP as responsible for the phenotype.
The expectation is that individuals with opposing phenotypes will have allelic variants of the gene.
If a polymorphism is determined, larger genetic screens are undertaken to verify the linkage.
However, these types of investigations have significant limitations. First, GWASs rarely identify coding alleles, as most variants identified by GWASs are within noncoding sequences and thus
may influence genes located some distance from them. Second, GWASs cannot identify causative
variants, only nonrecombinant loci, which typically contain multiple genes. Of the many loci associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases in humans revealed by GWASs, a large fraction
have been mapped to the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus (2). This finding is not surprising since the highly polymorphic MHC locus contains numerous genes that affect the adaptive
immune response to infections. However, due to the low level of recombination within the generich MHC locus (3), SNP-defined linkages within this region are generally spread over a relatively
wide area (1–2 Mb), making it difficult to definitively identify a candidate gene. Finally, significant difficulties remain in providing functional proof that a candidate gene within a given locus
encodes for a susceptibility factor because it is impossible to conduct such experiments in humans.
The mouse is by far the most commonly used model organism for in vivo viral pathogenesis studies as it allows for reduced complexity through standardized environmental and genetic conditions
and is cost efficient. In addition, the genome sequences of several strains, as well as many speciesspecific immunologic, molecular, and biochemical reagents, are widely available to the research
community, making it easier to map genes in the mouse (4).
Modern mouse genetics began at the turn of the twentieth century with two major contributors,
pet mouse breeder Abbie Lathrop and mammalian geneticist William Castle. Lathrop generated
several mouse colonies that varied in their coat color or tumor susceptibility, thereby generating
many progenitors of currently used mouse stocks. Castle and his students, in particular Clarence
C. Little, recognized the value of homozygous mice for studying inheritance and established the
first inbred strains by brother/sister mating of Lathrop’s mice for over 20 generations (5). Each
mouse within the inbred line is homozygous throughout the genome, and each inbred strain is
also isogenic (genetically identical) because all individuals trace back to a common ancestor. Since
Lathrop’s mice were generated by breeding mice captured in Japan, China, and Europe, all original
inbred strains were a mosaic of Mus musculus domesticus, Mus musculus musculus, and Mus musculus
casteneus, with the largest genetic component derived from M. m. domesticus (6).
Mouse breeders possessed mutant mice even before the onset of modern genetics, and these
mice have been instrumental in the expansion of the discipline. However, since all commonly used
inbred mice were derived from only three subspecies, their genomes are relatively nonpolymorphic (7). The relative lack of genetic polymorphisms in classical inbred strains can be overcome by
breeding these strains with mice from wild-derived strains. These wild-derived strains have been

recently established by inbreeding mice belonging to different species of Mus caught in nature.
These wild mice can be crossed with classical laboratory strains to produce viable and fertile offspring with a large number of polymorphisms of natural origin. In addition, various approaches
have been used to increase the frequency of spontaneous mutations in classical inbred mouse
lines. These approaches include treating male mice with mutagens such as N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENU) (8), which leads to point mutations, and using transposons such as Sleeping Beauty (9) or
piggyBac (10), which result in the insertion of specific DNA sequences randomly throughout the
genome.
The screening of mice from polymorphic backgrounds allows for the selection of those with
an altered phenotype, such as resistance to viral infection or virally induced disease. Once an individual or strain with an altered phenotype is identified, it is then used to define the mutation
conferring the phenotype. Of the multiple approaches for identifying genes responsible for a given
phenotype, mapping them by virtue of their chromosomal position (i.e., positional cloning or forward genetics) is the most straightforward. There are three major steps in positional cloning. The
first step is to map the resistance locus (assuming that the phenotype is controlled by a single
locus) to a specific chromosome and to define the region of the chromosome that can confer
the phenotype upon transfer to a susceptible genetic background. To accomplish this step, the
genomes of the susceptible and resistant mice used in the cross must have sufficient polymorphisms to distinguish specific regions between them. Positional cloning begins with producing
F1 mice and determining their phenotype. If F1 mice exhibit the resistant phenotype, the trait is
defined as dominant, and F1 mice are backcrossed to susceptible mice to generate N2 mice. If F1
mice exhibit the susceptible phenotype, the trait is defined as recessive, and N2 mice are generated
by backcrossing F1 mice to resistant mice (Figure 1). Alternatively, F1 mice (irrespective of their
phenotype) can also be intercrossed to generate F2 animals for subsequent phenotyping. N2 or
F2 mice are then phenotyped and subsequently genotyped, using either SNPs or microsatellite
markers (specific repeats that differ in length between strains), to determine the minimum region
from the resistant mouse genome that correlates with the resistant phenotype. Classical linkage
analysis, as well as fine mapping of the gene responsible for a given phenotype, is based on meiotic
recombination events that occur in the sperm and egg precursor cells. Meiotic recombination is
a very frequent event and occurs approximately 30 times in each individual germ cell. It has been
estimated that there is a 1% chance that two markers separated by ∼0.5–2 Mb will cross over in
a single generation. Therefore, the nonrecombinant region can be reduced to as small as 0.5 Mb
simply using genetic crosses.
Depending on the chromosomal location of the resistance gene, the nonrecombinant region
may be gene rich. Therefore, the second step in positional cloning is to reduce the size of the
chromosomal segment containing the resistance gene to a region containing the smallest number
of genes. This step requires additional genetic manipulation, such as the production of congenic
mouse lines and/or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic lines. A congenic line is produced by repeated backcrosses of mice from the resistant strain to mice from the susceptible strain
with selection for various overlapping chromosomal regions derived from the resistant mice. BAC
transgenic mice are generated by inserting overlapping fragments of DNA (from 100 to 300 kb)
from resistant mice into the genome of susceptible mice as transgenes. The end goal is to identify the smallest DNA fragment that can reverse the phenotype from susceptible to resistant in
infected mice.
The final step of positional cloning is the identification of the gene. This requires comparing
the sequence of the minimal region between resistant and susceptible animals. Mutations may be
obvious, such as deletions, frame shifts, or premature stop codons, or they may be less striking,
such as point mutations or mutations within a noncoding region. Therefore, providing functional

Positional cloning in mice. First, a strain with unique resistance to infection or disease is identified. Genetic crosses between resistant
and susceptible mice are then used to determine if the phenotype is dominant or recessive. Backcrosses are then conducted to generate
N2 animals; F1 mice are crossed to the susceptible strain if the phenotype is dominant or to the resistant strain if the phenotype is
recessive. The N2 animals are then used for physical mapping using SNPs or microsatellite markers to identify the region of the
genome linked to the phenotype. Linkage is determined by identifying a genomic region in which inheritance of the susceptible or
resistant genotype correlates with the appropriate phenotype (e.g., for a recessive phenotype, a region in which resistant animals are
homozygous for the genotype of the resistant parent strain and susceptible animals are heterozygous). The region is then narrowed (by
breeding approaches or testing larger numbers of N2 animals), and candidate genes (which transcripts are indicated by purple arrows
above the narrowed critical region) are selected for investigation of polymorphisms and for functional analysis. Finally, the gene must
be validated as causative of the phenotype (e.g., via a transgenic approach by introducing the dominant resistant allele of the candidate
gene onto the susceptible background and confirming that the transgene confers resistance in infected mice). Abbreviations: R, resistant
allele; S, susceptible allele; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.

proof that a candidate gene is responsible for conferring the phenotype is essential. One method to
accomplish this is via a transgenic approach by generating mice engineered to express the resistant
allele of the gene on the virus-susceptible background. Alternatively, a knock-in approach—the
replacement of one allele with another of the gene suspected to control the resistant phenotype—
can also be used to confirm the candidate gene.
Positional cloning can be a long journey, especially if the phenotype is recessive, as, at each step
of the cloning, mice must be bred to homozygosity prior to phenotyping. In addition, positional
cloning is best used in the cases of monogenic traits but can be overly burdensome for multigenic traits. To overcome this problem, in 2002, the members of the Complex-Trait Consortium

proposed the development of a new mouse genetics resource, called the Collaborative Cross (CC).
The CC combines the genomes of five classical laboratory lines (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ,
NOD/LtJ, and NZO/HlLtJ) and three wild-derived genetically diverse inbred mouse strains
(CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) (11). More than 500 individual inbred strains have been
produced from the CC. Since the genomes of each of the eight inbred strains that contributed to
the CC have been sequenced, the molecular genetic contribution of each chromosomal region of
each CC strain is known. Therefore, phenotyping each strain for a trait such as virus resistance allows the determination of a chromosomal location for a locus conferring a given phenotype faster
than traditional positional cloning. However, functional proof would still be required to confirm
a candidate gene.
Genes for which polymorphic alleles either increase or decrease susceptibility to viral infection or virally induced diseases may be grouped into five categories: (a) genes that block virus
entry (changes in receptors and/or coreceptors or receptor-modifying enzymes); (b) genes that
affect innate immune responses to viral infections, such as virus sensing or natural killer (NK)
cell responses; (c) genes that alter adaptive immune responses such as T, NK T cell, and B cell
responses; (d) genes encoding for restriction factors or intrinsic immune effectors; and (e) genes
that control viral pathogenesis. This review discusses examples of the successful identification
of genes belonging to the latter four categories using the approaches outlined above. Table 1
presents specific examples of genes in each of the categories and the mechanisms by which they
affect virus replication. However, this review does not serve as an exhaustive list of antiviral genes
identified using these approaches; it is instead intended to provide readers with an appreciation of
the astounding diversity and the common themes of defense to viral infection.

GENES THAT AFFECT INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES
TO VIRAL INFECTIONS
Pathogen-specific immune responses require the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular
patterns, highly conserved microbial structures that are not found in host cells, by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (12). Viral infections are recognized by cytosolic or endocytic PRRs that
detect viral genomes or replication intermediates (e.g., nucleic acids) (13), by inflammasomes that
detect the activities of virally encoded proteins (14), or by cytoplasmic factors sensing higherorder molecular structures such as a capsid lattice (15, 16). This detection activates innate immune effectors, stimulates inflammatory responses, and directs the pathogen-specific adaptive response. While some variability in innate immune function can be measured in vitro (e.g., PRR
signaling), in general, the role of the innate immune system in viral infection must be measured
in vivo.

Innate Immune Detection of Herpesvirus Infection
Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is widespread among wild mice (17), where it is initially contained by innate immune responses and then held in check by the adaptive immune response,
despite persisting in the salivary epithelium (18). Usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent
individuals, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients (19). Although the vast majority of wild mice are infected with MCMV, the infection is generally contained (17), suggesting that the mouse genome has evolved to cope with
this pathogen. To identify the mechanisms that are required for resistance to MCMV infection,
researchers performed a large-scale ENU mutagenesis screen using C57BL6/J (B6) mice (20, 21).

They found that mice homozygous for an L499P Tlr9 mutant allele were highly susceptible to
MCMV, and their macrophages showed impaired infection-induced secretion of type I interferons
(IFNs).
By screening macrophages derived from B6 mice homozygous for ENU-induced germline mutations, researchers identified a mutant mouse with cells that failed to produce normal quantities
of tumor necrosis factor in response to poly I:C (a TLR3 stimulus), resiquimod (a TLR7 stimulus),
and unmethylated DNA oligonucleotides bearing CpG motifs (a TLR9 stimulus). Using a positional cloning approach, researchers linked this poor response to TLR ligands to a missense allele
of Unc93b1. Unc93b1 encodes the 12-membrane-spanning protein UNC93B1, a highly conserved
molecule found in the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays an important role in the stability and
intracellular trafficking of various TLR molecules (22–24). Importantly, Unc93b1-deficient mice
have impaired clearance of MCMV (25), while UNC93B1-deficient human patients are prone to
developing herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis (26). Thus, these studies emphasized the importance of the intracellular DNA sensor, TLR9, and cellular chaperone UNC93B1 in controlling
herpes virus infections.

Natural Killer–Mediated Control of Mouse Cytomegalovirus Infection
NK cells are innate lymphocytes that are activated upon encountering infected cells. The activation of NK cells is determined by a delicate balance of signals delivered by inhibitory and activating
receptors (27). While inhibitory receptors engage ubiquitously expressed MHC class I molecules,
activating receptors recognize stress-induced ligands (27, 28). During viral infections, alterations
in the balance of these signals, such as MHC class I downregulation and/or upregulation of ligands
recognized by activating receptors, result in NK cell activation.
It has long been known that the outcome of MCMV infection is under multigenic control
and involves both MHC-specific and NK cell–specific mechanisms (29). Shellam, Bancroft, and
others first established that the spontaneous beige mutation, which occurred in B6 mice, was associated with an NK cell defect and increased susceptibility to MCMV (30, 31). Subsequently, these
observations were confirmed, as antibody (Ab)-mediated ablation of NK cells in wild-type mice
correlated with increased MCMV-associated mortality (32, 33). Furthermore, it was determined
that the initial stages of MCMV infection are controlled by a single locus, Cmv1, mapped to the
distal part of chromosome 6. The Cmv1 locus overlapped with the NK-cell complex (NKC) and
coincided with the beige mutation (34). Using positional cloning, researchers fine-mapped Cmv1
to the Ly49 gene cluster within the NKC (35, 36). Ly49 proteins are surface receptors that bind

to MHC class I molecules and are expressed in NK cells and in some specialized T cell subpopulations (37) (Figure 2).
Three groups almost simultaneously identified the gene encoding for Cmv1 (38–40). Two
groups used a recombinant inbred strain, BXD-8, derived from Cmv1-resistant (Cmv1R ) B6 and
Cmv1-susceptible DBA/2 parents. Although BXD-8 mice inherited the Cmv1R locus, they were
MCMV susceptible. Using linkage analyses and genetic complementation in vivo, researchers
mapped virus susceptibility of BXD-8 mice to the Cmv1 locus (39) and determined it to be the
result of a 23-kb deletion encompassing a member of the Ly49 gene family, Ly49h. While many
Ly49 receptors send inhibitory signals upon recognition of MHC class I molecules (29), Ly49H
was determined to be an NK-activating receptor (39, 40) and therefore was proposed to recognize a molecule uniquely expressed on MCMV-infected cells. It was subsequently determined that
MCMV encodes a structural homolog of MHC class I, m157, which directly activates Ly49H, thus
causing lysis of infected cells (41) (Figure 2).
The ability of NK cells to recognize and lyse cells expressing m157 prompts the question of
why this viral gene evolved and was maintained in the viral genome. Lanier’s group considered the
possibility that m157 evolved to bind an inhibitory receptor in MCMV-susceptible mice. It was
a reasonable suggestion, as the Ly49 receptor family exhibits considerable variation in different
mouse strains (42). Indeed, it was found that m157 can bind an inhibitory NK receptor (Ly49I) in
certain MCMV-susceptible strains of mice, such as 129/J mice (41). Thus, it appears that selective
pressure applied by the virus has influenced the evolution of an Ly49 receptor from inhibitory to
activating.

Humans possess just a single Ly49 gene that appears to express only aberrant transcripts. Instead, humans have a family of receptors called the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIRs) that are functionally analogous to the Ly49 receptors. Similar to mouse Ly49H, the human
activating KIR, NKG2D controls HCMV infection (28). However, NKG2D does not recognize
virally encoded proteins but instead binds to stress-induced MHC class I–related molecules, such
as MICA/MICB, that are induced as a result of infection (43). NKG2D binding to MICA/MICB
results in NK cell–mediated lysis of infected cells.

GENES THAT ALTER ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES
TO VIRAL INFECTIONS
The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the initial control of viral infections, but it is
also essential for directing adaptive immune responses. NF-κB-dependent gene expression, which
is induced as a result of triggering innate immune receptors, results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 (B7–1) and CD86 (B7–2) (44,
45). Costimulatory molecules are necessary for antigen presentation via MHC class I (required for
cytotoxic responses) and MHC class II (required for Ab responses) molecules to stimulate naïve
T cells and their subsequent differentiation into effector or helper cells, which are required for
orchestrating cytotoxic and humoral responses. Humoral responses involve B cells, which produce
antiviral Abs, thereby neutralizing extracellular viruses, while cytotoxic responses involve CD8+
T lymphocytes, which lyse infected cells, thereby controlling intracellular viral reservoirs.

Antibody-Mediated Virus Control
All virus-infected individuals produce antiviral Abs, and many diagnostic tests rely on virus-specific
Ab responses. However, Ab responses in virus-infected organisms, including humans, are often
ineffective. Two models of retroviral infection have provided the opportunity for understanding
the genetic basis of potent virus-neutralizing Ab responses.

Recovery from Friend Virus 3
The recovery from the Friend virus 3 (rfv3) gene was identified in 1979 by the Chesebro group
as a non-MHC locus that affected the persistence of viremia and the development of virusneutralizing Ab responses upon Friend murine leukemia virus (FV) infection (46). FV is composed of replication-competent Friend murine leukemia helper virus (F-MuLV) and defective
spleen focus-forming virus, the latter of which induces rapid proliferation of infected erythroid
progenitor cells manifesting in splenomegaly. FV is known to induce erythroleukemia in mice
from susceptible strains within a few months of infection.
While FV-infected mice from the A/WySn strain remained viremic, B10.A mice cleared
viremia within 30 days. Virus clearance was associated with the production of virus-neutralizing
Abs. Since F1 crosses between these two strains and approximately 50% of [(B10.A × A/WySn) ×
A/WySn]N2 mice exhibited the resistant phenotype of B10.A mice, the presence of a single
dominant gene of B10 origin associated with virus restriction was postulated and designated
as rfv3. Since B10.A and A/WySn mice share the same MHC locus, the contribution of the
MHC genes to the resistant phenotype was easily ruled out. The rfv3 locus was later mapped to
chromosome 15 via positional cloning (47, 48). The region was further fine-mapped to include
only one gene, Apobec3 (49, 50). Apobec3 encodes for a deoxycytidine deaminase and is a member of
the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme family, which is known to have broad antiretroviral

activity. Apobec3 is the only Apobec3 gene in rodents, whereas humans have seven Apobec3 genes
(51). APOBEC3 enzymes incorporate into newly forming retroviral particles and then induce
mutations in the viral cDNA that inhibit reverse transcription and render the provirus defective
(52). Retroviruses have evolved to evade APOBEC3 enzymes by excluding them from virions (52).
The resistant allele of Apobec3 in B10 mice is expressed at a higher level than in susceptible
A/WySn mice (49) and also generates aberrant splice variants with increased antiviral activity (50).
It was proposed that APOBEC3-mediated restriction of FV replication in B10 mice prevents the
rapid expansion of erythroid progenitor cells in the spleen and maintains normal splenic architecture, which is required for productive antiviral humoral responses. This hypothesis, however,
has not yet been tested. Mice expressing the resistant allele of Apobec3 on the virus-susceptible
background are needed to verify that Apobec3 encodes for Rfv3, and to determine the precise
mechanism by which it influences the production of virus-neutralizing Abs.

Virus Infectivity Controller 1
The rfv3-encoded resistance mechanism does not broadly protect against retroviral infections.
As a result, mice carrying the resistant allele of rfv3 are susceptible to other retroviruses, such
as mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (53). However, mice of the I/LnJ strain control both
MuLV and MMTV via the same immune mechanism, which involves the production of virusneutralizing Abs (53, 54). Although I/LnJ mice become infected with both MuLV and MMTV,
the mice produce virus-neutralizing Abs (54, 55), leading to the subsequent elimination of both
viruses (53, 54).
A single recessive locus, named virus infectivity controller 1 (vic1), controls retrovirus resistance in I/LnJ mice (54). I/LnJ mice carry a resistant allele of vic1, whereas MMTV-susceptible
C3H/HeN and B6 mice, as well as MMTV-susceptible and MuLV-susceptible BALB/cJ mice,
carry susceptible alleles (53, 54, 56, 57). The unusual recessive nature of resistance conferred by
the resistant allele of vic1, unique among all known virus restriction mechanisms, suggested that its
dominant counterpart was a negative regulator of the retrovirus-specific immune response. Using
positional cloning and a congenic approach, researchers mapped the vic1 gene to the MHC locus
of chromosome 17 (57), but MHC class I and class II (MHC II) genes were ruled out as candidates
for vic1 (58).
The 0.71-Mb nonrecombinant vic1 locus contained 39 genes, many of which were highly polymorphic between resistant and susceptible mice. To further reduce the size of the vic1 region, researchers performed a BAC phenotype rescue experiment. It was predicted that the expression of
the dominant susceptible B6 vic1 allele by a transgenic BAC should oppose the ability of resistant
mice to produce antiviral Abs. Using this approach, researchers reduced the critical region of vic1
to 32.9 Kb, which contained only two genes, H2-Ob and Gm15821. Subsequently, three nonsynonymous mutations resulting in nonfunctional protein were identified in the I/LnJ H2-Ob gene
(58).
The H2-Ob gene encodes the Oβ protein, which together with Oα (encoded by H2-Oa)
forms the MHC II-like molecule H2-O (59). H2-O functions as a negative regulator of
MHC II presentation (60) (Figure 3). The loading of MHC II molecules with peptides is
mediated by the interaction of MHC II with another nonpolymorphic MHC II–like molecule,
H2-M (61–63). H2-M replaces MHC II–associated invariant chain peptides (that protect the
MHC II peptide-binding groove until MHC II arrival in endosomal compartments) with
high-affinity, pathogen-derived peptides. H2-M function is opposed by H2-O, which acts as an
MHC II mimic, blocking the ability of H2-M to catalyze MHC II peptide loading (64). Thus,
the nonfunctional I/LnJ allele of H2-Ob was a promising candidate for vic1; this was proven by

demonstrating that when susceptible mice are H2-Ob deficient, they produce virus-neutralizing
Abs (58). Further analysis revealed alleles of the human homolog HLA-DOB that were linked to
a defect in neutralizing Ab responses against hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses (58).
The protective roles of specific alleles of classical MHC genes (class I and class II) against
many viral infections have been well documented (49, 65–69). The discovery that Vic1 is encoded
by H2-Ob revealed an unappreciated role for genes other than classical MHC molecules mapped
to the MHC locus in the regulation of virus-specific adaptive immunity. How H2-O negatively
controls Ab responses and why H2-O-deficient mice produce high titers of neutralizing Abs are
currently being investigated.

GENES ENCODING FOR PROTEINS WITH INTRINSIC
ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY
An essential component of host defense against viral infection is an arsenal of proteins with
direct antiviral activity. These proteins function as an intrinsic immune system, or a specialized
component of the innate immune system, and are often termed restriction factors (70). These
factors can be upregulated by type I IFNs or constitutively expressed (or both) (71). Importantly,

such proteins can dominantly and autonomously exhibit antiviral activity, including in cell culture
assays. A clear distinction between a restriction factor and an innate immune sensor is not
always obvious, with several of these factors apparently functioning as both autonomous antiviral
effectors and initiators of downstream responses (72). The antagonistic coevolution of virus and
host selects for adaptations that alter the specificity and/or function of these antiviral proteins,
generally resulting in great diversity of their amino acid sequences.

Mx Proteins

Compared to mice from other inbred strains, mice from the A2G strain are highly resistant to
disease caused by the influenza virus and other myxoviruses (73). Initial studies demonstrated
that the resistance was controlled by a dominant gene with IFN-dependent, cell-intrinsic antiviral activity named Mx1 (74–76). A GMP-binding protein induced by type I IFN and present
uniquely in Mx1+ cells was identified using [35 S] methionine labeling (77, 78). Using a panel of
mouse-hamster cell hybrids, researchers mapped the Mx1 gene to chromosome 16 (79). Mice from
influenza-susceptible strains were found to inherit large deletions or missense mutations in Mx1,
rendering the gene product nonfunctional (80).
Soon after the discovery of Mx1, a nearby homologous gene, Mx2, was identified (81). Like
Mx1, Mx2 is not expressed or is nonfunctional in the majority of inbred strains (81). However,
while murine Mx1 localizes to the nucleus, Mx2 is cytoplasmic and does not inhibit influenza
replication, although it potently restricts other viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
and Hantaan virus (82). Since these early investigations, it has become clear that Mx proteins
are key mediators of cell autonomous antiviral defenses and are present in divergent vertebrates,
including mammals, birds, and fish. These proteins vary in both their subcellular localization and
their antiviral activity, but are all type I IFN-induced dynamin-like GTPases. For example, human
Mx1 is cytoplasmic and inhibits a variety of viruses, including, but not limited to, influenza A,
measles, VSV, and HBV (82) (Figure 4). Human Mx2, on the other hand, is localized at the nuclear
pore and inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpesviruses (83–87). These proteins
generally inhibit early stages in the viral life cycle by targeting subviral structures such as the
nucleocapsid or core, and, except in the case of inhibition of HIV infection by Mx2, restriction
by these proteins requires GTP hydrolysis (82) (Figure 4). The molecular mechanisms by which
Mx proteins inhibit viral replication and what makes seemingly unrelated viruses sensitive to the
same Mx proteins remain questions of significant interest.

Control of Flavivirus Infection by Oas1b
Variability in susceptibility to flaviviruses in mice was first identified in the 1930s in studies comparing susceptibility to encephalitis caused by yellow fever virus (YFV) (88). It was subsequently
determined that susceptibility to multiple members of the Flavivirus genus, including dengue virus
and West Nile virus (WNV), was controlled by a single dominant locus designated Flv (89, 90).
While mice from most inbred laboratory strains inherit the susceptible allele of Flv, wild M. m.
domesticus mice, as well as wild mice from other Mus species, inherit the dominant allele of the
gene conferring virus resistance (90, 91).
Mice from the Princeton Rockefeller Institute (PRI) outbred stock were resistant to YFV, as
they inherited the dominant allele of Flv (92). To study the mechanism by which the PRI Flv alleles
control the virus (in isolation from other genetic influences), researchers transferred the locus containing the gene onto the virus-susceptible C3H/He background, thus generating virus-resistant
C3H.PRI mice (93). Using these mice, researchers determined that Flv-mediated resistance acts
in a cell-intrinsic fashion to control viral replication and does not require type I IFNs (94).

Using crosses between susceptible C3H/HeJ and BALB/cJ mice and resistant C3H/RV mice,
researchers mapped Flv to a 1 Mb region of chromosome 5 (95, 96). Flv was subsequently found to
encode for Oas1b, a 2 –5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (2 –5 -OAS) (97), and a premature stop codon
was identified in the susceptible allele of Oas1b (97, 98). Ectopic expression of the resistant allele
of Oas1b was sufficient to control WNV replication in susceptible cells, and knock-in of a resistant
allele of Oas1b in susceptible mice conferred the flavivirus resistance phenotype (97, 99).
The OAS enzymes bind dsRNA in the cytoplasm and catalyze the production of 2 –5 -linked
oligoadenylate from ATP. The 2 –5 -linked oligoadenylate serves as a secondary messenger that
activates RNaseL, which then degrades both viral and cellular RNAs to prevent viral replication

(100). However, the mechanism by which murine Oas1b inhibits flavivirus replication is not fully
defined, as it may not involve enzymatic activity or the activation of RNaseL (101). In addition,
the precise viral target recognized by Oas1b upon flavivirus infection has not been identified.
Since the identification of the Flv gene, some human and equine OAS1 alleles have been linked
to increased susceptibility to WNV-induced encephalitis (102), demonstrating the importance of
Oas1 in the control of WNV infection across multiple species. Alleles of human Oas1 with reduced
activity against WNV were also found to have a reduced ability to inhibit HCV replication and
are indicators of disease progression in HCV-infected patients (103–105).

Endogenous Retroelements Repurposed as Restriction Factors

Investigation of inbred mice with differential susceptibility to MuLV has revealed several loci
responsible for the outcome of infection. One such locus, Fv4 (Friend virus susceptibility gene 4),
was found in laboratory mice, as well as in wild Californian and Asian mice, in 1970 and was quickly
identified as an endogenous retroviral envelope (env) gene that directly blocks the interaction of
exogenous ecotropic MuLV with its receptor, CAT1 (106–108). Most endogenous retroviruses lose
their coding capacity due to neutral (or negative) selection; however, in multiple vertebrate species,
intact env genes such as Fv4 have been preserved for their protective receptor interference activity
(109). Nevertheless, it was more than 40 years after the phenomenon of receptor interference
was identified before such a gene was identified in humans. In humans, the env gene from an
endogenous provirus of the human endogenous retrovirus T lineage has been maintained and
was found to block infection of a reconstructed ancestral human endogenous virus (110).
Like Fv4, Fv1 (Friend virus susceptibility gene 1) was identified in the 1970s as a dominant
gene that restricted MuLV replication 10- to 1000-fold in vitro and protected mice from virally
induced leukemia (111, 112). Two major alleles of Fv1 are present in inbred mice, Fv1n and Fv1b
(113). N-tropic MuLV strains (infectious in NIH Swiss mice) are able to efficiently infect Fv1n/n
mice but not Fv1b/b mice, B-tropic strains (infectious in BALB/cJ mice) exhibit the opposite phenotype, while NB-tropic strains can efficiently infect either strain (113–115). The viral determinants for NB-tropism were later mapped to the viral capsid (116). Furthermore, restriction could
be abrogated by treatment of cells with inactive viral particles, indicating that Fv1 is a saturable
capsid targeting factor (117, 118). Unique among the resistance genes described here, Fv1 is also
codominant, as Fv1n/b heterozygous mice are resistant to both N- and B-tropic strains (113).
Positional cloning was used to map Fv1 to chromosome 4 near the locus for black or brown hair
color (115). Yeast artificial chromosomes containing fragments of the critical region from C57BL
mice (Fv1b/b ) were then tested in functional assays for their ability to alter the MuLV susceptibility
of Fv1n/n cells. This approach revealed that Fv1 is encoded by the gag gene of murine endogenous
retrovirus L (119). It is now appreciated that there are many alleles of Fv1, besides N and B, with
diverse antiretroviral activity (120, 121), indicating that Fv1-mediated mechanisms have defended
the Mus genus from various retroviral infections.
Fv1 does not have an ortholog present in other species. However, some primate species exhibit
HIV restriction that is similar to the Fv1-mediated restriction of MuLV (122). The mechanism
involves TRIM5α, which acts as a lentivirus capsid-specific restriction factor (123). Despite having
little to no primary sequence homology, Fv1 and TRIM5α (as well as MX2) share structural features that are critical for their function as capsid-specific restriction factors, including a coiled-coil
dimerization/multimerization domain and a domain responsible for binding their targets. The latter domains (the C-terminal domain of Fv1, the SPRY domain of TRIM5α, and the N-terminal
domain of MX2) are the most variable and determine target specificity and therefore retroviral
tropism (124). The implications of capsid-specific intrinsic immunity are far-reaching, as drugs
that mimic this activity have significant potential as therapeutic agents.

GENES THAT CONTROL VIRAL PATHOGENESIS
The outcomes of viral infections can also be affected by disease pathology such as inflammation,
alterations in vascular permeability, pulmonary pathology, and shock. Variability in these types of
disease phenotypes is also often under the control of host genes.

Genetic Control of Virally Induced Vascular Pathology
Lethal Ebola virus infection is characterized by a severe Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), coagulopathy, vascular permeability, and shock. These symptoms were initially difficult to reproduce
in nonprimate models of infection; however, the use of a panel of CC mice and a mouse-adapted
Ebola virus (MA-EBOV) have provided the opportunity to investigate the genetic basis for multiple disease phenotypes induced by Ebola virus (125). The eight CC founder mouse lines challenged with MA-EBOV showed disease phenotypes ranging from complete resistance to severe
EHF-associated pathology and death. Two representative lines with opposing phenotypes were
chosen for subsequent studies. Although mice from both lines lost approximately 15% of their
body weight five days post infection, only susceptible mice succumbed to lethal infection and developed EHF, whereas resistant mice survived and fully recovered their body weight by day 14
with no evidence of EHF.
Upon investigation of the transcriptional host responses, researchers identified two genes, Tie1
and Tie2, as differentially expressed in the livers and spleens of resistant and susceptible animals
(125). Tie1 and Tie2 encode for an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase and for an endothelial-specific
receptor tyrosine kinase, respectively, and both are essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival during angiogenesis and systemic inflammation (126–128). The eight CC
founders have three highly divergent alleles of Tie1, and thus, the specific allele associated with
the resistant phenotypes could not be determined. In contrast, there are only two divergent Tie2
alleles in the CC lines, and distinct Tie2 alleles were previously associated with inflammatory coagulopathies and vascular dysfunction in humans (129, 130). However, functional proof that a
specific allele of Tie2 is responsible for conferring the survival of lethal Ebola virus infection in
mice from resistant CC founder strains has not been provided.

Genetic Control of Virally Induced Lung Pathology
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in humans in Southeast Asia
in 2002 (131), causes an atypical pneumonia fatal in 10% of all patients and 50% of elderly patients (132). Host genetics are thought to influence disease severity, but an understanding of the
underlying mechanisms was complicated by the limited scope of the SARS epidemic in humans
and varying treatment regiments (132, 133).
Mice from the eight CC founder strains exhibit a wide range of susceptibility to SARS-CoVinduced inflammation and pathology (134). Of four loci associated with disease outcome, one locus
was specifically linked to vascular cuffing (accumulation of fluid or cells around blood vessels) and
was identified by virtue of its polymorphism between susceptible and resistant mice as Trim55
(134). An E3 ubiquitin ligase, Trim55 is expressed in smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels
and is essential for muscle development and cardiac function (135). SARS-CoV-infected C57BL/6
mice deficient in Trim55 showed significantly reduced vascular cuffing and increased immune
cell infiltration in the lungs compared to wild-type mice (134), revealing a novel role for Trim55
in acute viral-induced lung injury. However, mutations found in SARS-CoV-susceptible Trim55
alleles were not reported (134).
The other locus was revealed by using F2 crosses obtained from CC sublines showing extreme divergent responses to SARS-CoV. One strain was highly resistant to virally induced

disease despite having high viral loads, while the other exhibited high mortality and weight loss
despite low viral loads (136). The latter inherited four missense mutations in Ticam2 from the
PWK/PhJ founder strain. The overall importance of Ticam2, but not the PWK/PhJ allele of the
gene, in controlling SARS-CoV-induced disease was confirmed by showing that Ticam2 knock-out
mice were highly susceptible to the virus-induced disease (136). Ticam2 is an adaptor for MyD88independent TLR4 signaling (137); however, the mechanism by which the virus activates TLR4
signaling remains unknown.

CENTURY

Numerous genes with variants that strongly affect the outcomes of viral infections have been
identified using classical genetics in both animal and human (family-based) studies. Frequently,
however, many genetic variants with weak individual effects cumulatively contribute to the same
phenotype, making discrete gene identification difficult. In contrast to classical genetics, recent
advances in sequencing and data analysis technologies have paved the way for genomics, the study
of all of an organism’s genes or the genome as a whole. Genomics researchers can analyze massive
amounts of sequence data to find genetic variants, or combinations therein that can potentially
affect infection and disease outcome. The downside of this approach is that, unlike in classical
genetics, the experiments required to validate the contribution of variants identified by genomic
approaches to the disease phenotype are not always possible. The major issue is that most SNPs are
positioned within noncoding regions and thus are only proxies for genes whose identities are yet to
be determined. In addition, the critical region revealed by a SNP often contains many genes, making identification of the causative gene merely speculative. Therefore, a classical genetic approach
would still be required to validate the role of variants identified through genomic analysis. On the
other hand, gene identification through classical genetics can be helped enormously by computational biology through the identification of allelic variants, their tissue-specific expression pattern,
and the prediction of signaling pathways a gene may be involved in. For now, classical genetics
remains an essential tool for linking genes to phenotypes, but it can integrate genomic approaches
and benefit from them. The benefit, however, is mutual.
