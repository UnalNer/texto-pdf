ABSTRACT

The newly identiﬁed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-conﬁrmed human
infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no speciﬁc
antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV
and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein,
which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019nCoV. Here, we report for the ﬁrst time that a SARS-CoV-speciﬁc human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind
potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site
within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate
therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-speciﬁc neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014)
that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the diﬀerence in
the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it
is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind speciﬁcally to 2019-nCoV RBD.

Very recently, a novel coronavirus which was temporarily named “2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)”
emerged in Wuhan, China [1]. As of 1 February
2020, 2019-nCoV has resulted in a total of 11,821 laboratory-conﬁrmed human infections in China, including 259 deaths, and 132 exported cases in 23 countries
outside of China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/
diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).
Currently, there is no vaccine or eﬀective antiviral
treatment against 2019-nCoV infection.
Based on the phylogenetic analysis (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_402124) [2], 2019-nCoV belongs to
lineage B betacoronavirus and shares high sequence
identity with that of bat or human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related coronavirus
(SARSr-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SLCoV) (Figure 1(a)). In previous studies, a number of
potent monoclonal antibodies against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been identiﬁed [3–7]. These
antibodies target the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV

and SL-CoVs, which is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and mediates the entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
[8]. More speciﬁcally, the 193 amino acid length
(N318-V510) receptor binding domain (RBD) within
the S protein is the critical target for neutralizing antibodies [9]. Some of the antibodies recognize diﬀerent
epitopes on RBD; e.g. the SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies CR3014 and CR3022 bound noncompetitively
to the SARS-CoV RBD and neutralized the virus in a
synergistic fashion [5]. We predicted the conformation
of 2019-nCoV RBD as well as its complex structures
with several neutralizing antibodies, and found that
the modelling results support the interactions between
2019-nCoV RBD and certain SARS-CoV antibodies
(Figure 1(b)). This could be due to the relatively high
identity (73%) of RBD in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV
(Figure 1(c)). For instance, residues in RBD of SARSCoV that make polar interactions with a neutralizing
