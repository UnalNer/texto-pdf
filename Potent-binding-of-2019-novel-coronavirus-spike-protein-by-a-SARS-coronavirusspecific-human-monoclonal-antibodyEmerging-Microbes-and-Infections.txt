ABSTRACT

The newly identiﬁed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-conﬁrmed human
infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no speciﬁc
antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV
and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein,
which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019nCoV. Here, we report for the ﬁrst time that a SARS-CoV-speciﬁc human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind
potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site
within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate
therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-speciﬁc neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014)
that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the diﬀerence in
the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it
is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind speciﬁcally to 2019-nCoV RBD.

KEYWORDS 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV; ACE2; monoclonal antibody; RBD

Very recently, a novel coronavirus which was temporarily named “2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)”
emerged in Wuhan, China [1]. As of 1 February
2020, 2019-nCoV has resulted in a total of 11,821 laboratory-conﬁrmed human infections in China, including 259 deaths, and 132 exported cases in 23 countries
outside of China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/
diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).
Currently, there is no vaccine or eﬀective antiviral
treatment against 2019-nCoV infection.
Based on the phylogenetic analysis (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_402124) [2], 2019-nCoV belongs to
lineage B betacoronavirus and shares high sequence
identity with that of bat or human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related coronavirus
(SARSr-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SLCoV) (Figure 1(a)). In previous studies, a number of
potent monoclonal antibodies against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been identiﬁed [3–7]. These
antibodies target the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV

and SL-CoVs, which is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and mediates the entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
[8]. More speciﬁcally, the 193 amino acid length
(N318-V510) receptor binding domain (RBD) within
the S protein is the critical target for neutralizing antibodies [9]. Some of the antibodies recognize diﬀerent
epitopes on RBD; e.g. the SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies CR3014 and CR3022 bound noncompetitively
to the SARS-CoV RBD and neutralized the virus in a
synergistic fashion [5]. We predicted the conformation
of 2019-nCoV RBD as well as its complex structures
with several neutralizing antibodies, and found that
the modelling results support the interactions between
2019-nCoV RBD and certain SARS-CoV antibodies
(Figure 1(b)). This could be due to the relatively high
identity (73%) of RBD in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV
(Figure 1(c)). For instance, residues in RBD of SARSCoV that make polar interactions with a neutralizing

antibody m396 as indicated by the complex crystal
structure [10] are invariably conserved in 2019-nCoV
RBD (Figure 1(d)). In the structure of SARS-CoVRBD-m396, R395 in RBD formed a salt bridge with
D95 of m396-VL. Concordantly, the electrostatic interaction was also observed in the model of 2019-nCoVRBD-m396, forming by R408 (RBD) and D95
(m396-VL). This analysis suggests that some SARSCoV-speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies may be eﬀective
in neutralizing 2019-nCoV. In contrast, the interactions between antibody F26G19 [11] or 80R [12]
and the RBD in 2019-nCoV decreased signiﬁcantly
due to the lack of salt bridges formed by R426-D56
in SARS-CoV-RBD-F26G19 or D480-R162 in SARSCoV-RBD-80R, respectively. Furthermore, while most
of the 80R-binding residues on the RBD of SARSCoV are not conserved on RBD of 2019-nCoV (Figure
1(c)), it is unlikely that the antibody 80R could eﬀectively recognize 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is urgent to
experimentally determine the cross-reactivity of antiSARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein,
which could have important implications for rapid
development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies
against 2019-nCoV.
In this study, we ﬁrst expressed and puriﬁed 2019nCoV RBD protein. We also predicted the conformations of 2019-nCoV RBD and its complex with the
putative receptor, human ACE2. Comparison of the
interaction between the complex of ACE2 [13] and
SARS-CoV RBD and homology model of ACE2 and
2019-nCoV RBD revealed similar binding modes
(data not shown). In both complexes, β5–β6 loop and
β6–β7 loop form extensive contact, including at least
seven pairs of hydrogen bonds, with the receptor. Notably, R426 on the forth α helix in SARS-CoV RBD builds
a salt bridge with E329 and a hydrogen bond with Q325
on ACE2. However, the arginine (R426 in SARS-CoV
RBD) to asparagine (N439) mutation in 2019-nCoV
RBD abolished the strong polar interactions, which
may induce a decrease in the binding aﬃnity between
RBD and the receptor. Interestingly, a lysine (K417 in
2019-nCoV RBD) replacement of valine (V404 in
SARS-CoV RBD) on β6 formed an extra salt bridge
with D30 on ACE2, which may recover the binding
ability. These data indicate that the RBD in S protein
of 2019-nCoV may bind to ACE2 with a similar
aﬃnity as SARS-CoV RBD does. Indeed, we measured
the binding of 2019-nCoV RBD to human ACE2 by
the biolayer interferometry binding (BLI) assay, and
found that 2019-nCoV RBD bound potently to ACE2.
The calculated aﬃnity (KD) of 2019-nCoV RBD with
human ACE2 was 15.2 nM (Figure 1(f)), which is comparable to that of SARS-CoV spike protein with human
ACE2 (15 nM) [14]. These results indicate that ACE2
could be the potential receptor for the new coronavirus,
and that the expressed 2019-nCoV RBD protein is functional [2].

Next, we expressed and puriﬁed several representative SARS-CoV-speciﬁc antibodies which have been
reported to target RBD and possess potent neutralizing
activities, including m396 [3], CR3014 [4], CR3022 [5],
as well as a MERS-CoV-speciﬁc human monoclonal
antibody m336 developed by our laboratory [15], and
measured their binding ability to 2019-nCoV RBD by
ELISA (Figure 1(e)). Surprisingly, we found that most
of these antibodies did not show evident binding to
2019-nCoV RBD. To conﬁrm this result, we further
measured the binding kinetics using BLI. An irrelevant
anti-CD40 antibody was used as a negative control.
Similarly, the antibody m396, which was predicted to
bind 2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 1(d)), only showed
slight binding at the highest measured concentration
(2.0 µM). Further studies are needed to solve the
high-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV RBD and
understand why it could not be recognized by these
antibodies.
Notably, one SARS-CoV-speciﬁc antibody, CR3022,
was found to bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD as
determined by ELISA and BLI (Figure 1(e,f)). It followed a fast-on (kon of 1.84 × 105 Ms−1) and slow-oﬀ
(koﬀ of 1.16 × 10−3 s−1) binding kinetics, resulting in
a KD of 6.3 nM (Figure 1(f)). This antibody was isolated from blood of a convalescent SARS patient and
did not compete with the antibody CR3014 for binding
to recombinant S protein [5]. To further elucidate the
binding epitopes of CR3022, we measured the competition of CR3022 and human ACE2 for the binding to
2019-nCoV RBD. The streptavidin biosensors labelled
with biotinylated 2019-nCoV RBD were saturated with
human ACE2 in solution, followed by the addition of
the test antibodies in the presence of ACE2. As
shown in Figure 1(g), the antibody CR3022 did not
show any competition with ACE2 for the binding to
2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022,
distinct from the other two SARS-CoV antibodies,
recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the
ACE2 binding site of 2019-nCoV RBD.
The RBD of 2019-nCoV diﬀers largely from the
SARS-CoV at the C-terminus residues (Figure 1(c)).
Our results implied that such a diﬀerence did not result
in drastic changes in the capability to engage the ACE2
receptor, but had a critical impact on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies. Some of the most potent
SARS-CoV-speciﬁc neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396,
CR3014) that target the receptor binding site of SARSCoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that it is necessary to develop novel monoclonal
antibodies that could bind speciﬁcally to 2019-nCoV
RBD. Interestingly, it was reported that the antibody
CR3022 completely neutralized both the wild-type
SARS-CoV and the CR3014 escape viruses at a concentration of 23.5 μg/ml, and that no escape variants could
be generated with CR3022 [5]. Furthermore, the mixture of CR3022 and CR3014 neutralized SARS-CoV

Emerging Microbes & Infections

in a synergistic fashion by recognizing diﬀerent epitopes on RBD [5]. These results suggest that CR3022
has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of
2019-nCoV infections. We expect more cross-reactive
antibodies against 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV or
other coronaviruses to be identiﬁed soon, facilitating
the development of eﬀective antiviral therapeutics
and vaccines.
