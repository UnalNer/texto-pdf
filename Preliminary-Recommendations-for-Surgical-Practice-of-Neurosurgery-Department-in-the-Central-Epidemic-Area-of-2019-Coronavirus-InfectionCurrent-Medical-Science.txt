Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
posed significant threats to the public health and life in China. Unlike the other 6 identified
coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety
of manifestations. In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent
to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission.
Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan,
and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience.
These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve ‘zero infection’ of doctors and nurses
in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight
2019-nCoV infection.

Since December 2019, several cases of atypical
pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan. On January
2020, a novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from
the throat swab sample of pneumonia patients, and was
named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World
Health Organization (WHO)[1, 2]. By 28 February 2020,
nearly 78 959 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed
nationwide with another 2308 cases suspected.
In the last decades, 6 coronavirus species (CoVs)
have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well
as their regular intermediate hosts, such as birds and
mammals. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) in 2012
has revealed the lethality of CoVs when they infect
humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the 7th identified member
of CoVs family[3-5]. Phylogenetic genome sequencing
has shown that SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related
(89.1% similarity) to a group of SARS-like CoVs[6].
Retrospective studies revealed that the typical
clinical manifestations were fever, cough, and dyspnea.
However, a number of patients only presented initially

with gastrointestinal symptoms. Evidence has shown
that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
had occurred by close contacts or through virus-laden
aerosols[7, 8]. The incubation period ranged from 3 days
to 14 days[9, 10]. Patients may develop a rapid and serious
dyspnea in a few days after infection. The mortality was
about 3.5% according to the latest government report.
Although WHO suggested that the current
event did not constitute a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern (PHEIC), the COVID-19
situation exerted significant threats to public health and
life in China[11, 12]. Fortunately, the Chinese government
made a rapid and effective response to this situation and
made a great progress in protecting citizens from virus
transmission. Wuhan City became the battlefront to
fight COVID-19, and most doctors devoted themselves
to this white war. Under novel coronavirus pneumonia
situation, regular clinical work in the local hospital was
seriously restricted. Especially, it became much more
challenging to deal with the surgical requests for patients
with central nervous system (CNS) diseases. As the
largest neurosurgical center in Wuhan, Neurosurgery
Department of Tongji Hospital performed surgical
treatments for patients in the epidemic situation. We
carried out some management proposals of the patients
on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and
clinical experiences. These recommendations have
helped us until now to achieve ‘zero infection’ of
doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to
share with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight
novel coronavirus infection.
2 Recommendations for the management of patients
with CNS diseases
2.1 Preoperative evaluation and management
All patients were first applied to the special fever
clinics in out-patient department. After temperature
test, a careful history query (especially the fever and
cough manifestations in the last 2 weeks) and physical
examination were performed by doctors from both outpatient and neurosurgery departments under strict third
level protection (medical masks, protective goggles
and suit). Surgical indications should be rigorously
evaluated and surgical treatment should be preserved
for patients with emergency condition, such as ruptured
aneurysm and intracranial hemorrhage. Operations
for patients with relatively stable condition should be
postponed, for example, patients with benign brain
tumors. These patients were documented and followedup through phone call.
A pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan
and nucleic acid sequencing of throat swab were
recommended for preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19
