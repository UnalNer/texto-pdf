Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially
fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were
exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of
COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of
COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and eﬀorts to protect or
reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and
elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.

Coronavirus is one of the major pathogens that primarily targets the
human respiratory system. Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs)
include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and the
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV which have been previously characterized as agents that are a great public health threat. In
late December 2019, a cluster of patients was admitted to hospitals with
an initial diagnosis of pneumonia of an unknown etiology. These patients were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal
wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1,2]. Early reports
predicted the onset of a potential Coronavirus outbreak given the estimate of a reproduction number for the 2019 Novel (New) Coronavirus
(COVID-19, named by WHO on Feb 11, 2020) which was deemed to be
signiﬁcantly larger than 1 (ranges from 2.24 to 3.58) [3].
The chronology of COVID-19 infections is as follows. The ﬁrst cases
were reported in December 2019 [4]. From December 18, 2019 through
December 29, 2019, ﬁve patients were hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome and one of these patients died[5]. By January 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identiﬁed as
having laboratory-conﬁrmed COVID-19 infection, less than half of these
patients had underlying diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and

cardiovascular disease [6]. These patients were presumed to be infected
in that hospital, likely due to nosocomial infection. It was concluded
that the COVID-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus (spread by one
patient to many others), but rather likely spread due to many patients
getting infected at various locations throughout the hospital through
unknown mechanisms. In addition, only patients that got clinically sick
were tested, thus there were likely many more patients that were presumably infected. As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the
2019-new coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in 25 provinces
(districts and cities) in China [7]. The China National Health Commission reported the details of the ﬁrst 17 deaths up to January 22,
2020. On January 25, 2020, a total of 1975 cases were conﬁrmed to be
infected with the COVID-19 in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths
[8]. Another report on January 24, 2020 estimated the cumulative incidence in China to be 5502 cases [9]. As of January 30, 2020, 7734
cases have been conﬁrmed in China and 90 other cases have also been
reported from a number of countries that include Taiwan, Thailand,
Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Japan, Singapore,
Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirates, United States, The Philippines, India, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Germany. The
case fatality rate was calculated to be 2.2% (170/7824) [10]. The ﬁrst
case of COVID-19 infection conﬁrmed in the United States led to the
