Abstract
A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a
potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts
are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals.
Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to
prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued
intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection,
despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude
potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in
patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in
developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the
options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody
therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome,
emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I
advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could
be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal
is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an
immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody
with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit
the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would
also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection,
thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a
third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is
provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein
expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under
compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a
treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is
developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).

REVISED

Amendments from Version 1

In the updated version of the manuscript, the use of recombinant
ACE2 is highlighted as a treatment for acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), including several studies exploring its use
to treat ARDS during RSV and H5N1 infection. Importantly, two
clinical trials employing recombinant ACE2 are described, which
provides important data for the safety of translating the ACE2-Fc
approach into human patients in an expedited manner. Given
the potential for ACE2-Fc to have this third mechanism of action,
the focus was shifted toward using the wild type ACE2 sequence
rather than abolishing peptidase activity. Overall, this additional
evidence increases the potential for ACE2-Fc to have a positive
therapeutic benefit in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.

Introduction
A mysterious illness causing pneumonia in December 2019
in Wuhan, China is now growing into a potential pandemic.
These pneumonia cases were eventually characterized to
be caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)1, of which
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)2 and Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)3 are members. SARS and
MERS famously caused their own outbreak concerns when they
were originally identified. SARS caused significant economic
damage to Hong Kong and Southern China, before spreading to other countries. Ultimately, SARS infected up to 8,098
people and caused 774 deaths according to the World Health
Organization (WHO)4.
The novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is now quickly spreading across the world after originating in Wuhan1. Human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCoV has been confirmed in
familial case cluster reports5, as additional cases continue to be
identified in different cities in China and countries around the
world. Clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection include fever,
cough, and myalgia or fatigue with pneumonia demonstrated
on chest CT scan imaging6. Within China, the city of Wuhan
along with several others has been shut down, with individuals not allowed to leave the city in an effort to contain the virus;
such efforts are largely unprecedented in a city of this size
(https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/coronavirusquarantines-history.html). For now, many travelers are being
screened for fever (≥38°C) and reported recent history of travel
to Wuhan in order to triage diagnostic testing7.
These efforts resemble not only what happened with SARS in
2002–2003, but also the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014–2015.
During those outbreaks, special protocols were put in place
to quarantine any infected individuals and identify patient
contacts at risk8. Healthcare workers were also at risk, and
despite extensive personal protective equipment measures, clinical providers did get infected in both outbreaks9. There were
no specific, antiviral treatments for SARS or Ebola at the
time of the outbreaks beyond supportive measures10,11, which
is a similar situation that healthcare systems are facing with
2019-nCoV.

The dire situations facing patients in outbreak scenarios demand
quick responses by the healthcare community and the biotech industry. Unfortunately, many of the traditional options
that guide drug development are inadequate for outbreaks;
a process that takes years can’t help patients who are dying
today, and economies that are being halted. In these situations,
studies have often been conducted on compassionate use,
and clinical trial approvals expedited. This was most recently
seen in the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak, where a variety of
clinical trial candidates were studied. Many of these therapies failed, but ultimately a vaccine did emerge that was fully
protective against the virus12. It is important to note that, unlike
the current situation with 2019-nCoV, Ebola had already been
studied for years and this particular neutralizing vaccine made
and tested in preclinical animal models years prior to the outbreak13. For 2019-nCoV, beyond knowing the sequence of
spike (S) protein of the coronavirus (GenBank: MN908947.3),
there are no studies on how immunogenic this particular protein will be beyond surrogate comparisons to SARS and MERS,
which limits the potential ability to quickly produce a vaccine. Moreover, while a vaccine would be greatly effective in
helping to stop the spread of 2019-nCoV, an effective therapy
is also needed for the patients infected with 2019-nCoV today,
similar to the situation of Ebola patients needing effective
therapies while vaccines were being developed.
In this article, I will outline different potential treatment options
that could be pursued as a therapy for 2019-nCoV virus, keeping the focus on agents that could be rapidly tested in patients
today and broadly effective in spite of limited knowledge
of the biology of 2019-nCoV. Simply stated, there is limited time for basic studies of 2019-nCoV in research labs,
while patients need effective therapies today. I finally propose
the best potential treatment option in my opinion, along with
instructions on how to manufacture the therapy for testing in
patients today.

Treatment strategies against 2019-nCoV
Developing neutralizing antibodies to 2019-nCoV
Coronavirus entry starts with the S protein binding to a target receptor on the cell surface, where after fusion is mediated
at the cell membrane, delivering the viral nucleocapsid inside
the cell for subsequent replication14. The S protein is famous for
causing syncytial formation between infected cells and other
receptor-bearing cells around them, emphasizing that the
S protein does not function in just the virion state alone.
A neutralizing antibody targeting the S protein on the surface
of 2019-nCoV is likely the first therapy contemplated by biomedical researchers in academia and industry, providing passive
immunity to disease15. The recently published genome sequence
of 2019-nCoV (GenBank: MN908947.3) allows researchers to perform gene synthesis in the lab and consider expressing the S protein as an immunogen. Traditional methods of
screening mice or rabbits for neutralizing antibodies may be
too slow for this outbreak, but faster methods such as using
phage or yeast display libraries that express antibody fragments

F1000Research 2020, 9:72 Last updated: 03 APR 2020

could be used quickly to identify lead candidates for viral
neutralization16,17. The challenge is that any antibody candidate
would need to be rigorously tested in cell culture and animal
models to confirm that it can neutralize 2019-nCoV and
prevent infection. Furthermore, several isolates would need to
be tested that are circulating in the population to try to assess if
sufficient breadth of coverage is obtained with the neutralizing antibody. Information from other coronaviruses species like
SARS would be helpful as to where to target the best epitope
in order to produce neutralizing antibodies (the receptorbinding domain in the S protein is a key target)18, but again
this is a slow and challenging process, which may not yield
significant gains for several months. Moreover, ultimately a
cocktail of antibodies may be required to ensure full protection
for patients, which would add additional complexity for formulation and manufacturing. Like some of the therapeutic options
discussed below, the ability to express any lead candidates in
lower organisms for protein expression (bacteria, yeast, insect
cells) would facilitate faster production of therapy for patients19.
An alternative strategy of generating neutralizing antibodies
against 2019-nCoV S protein would be to immunize large animals (sheep, goat, cow) with the 2019-nCoV S protein, and
then purifying polyclonal antibodies from the animals20. This
strategy may serve an expedited service in the setting of an outbreak and has many advantages such as simplifying production
and manufacturing, but has limited guarantees that each animal
would produce neutralizing antisera, or what the antibody
titer would be in each animal21. Moreover, there is also the
human immune response against foreign immunoglobulins to other species, which would potentially complicate any
treatment scenarios22. In a truly desperate scenario, this strategy
may be viable for a short-term, but would not easily scale in the
2019-nCoV outbreak, which is already rapidly multiplying.

Using oligonucleotides against 2019-nCoV RNA genome
Beyond targeting the surface proteins of 2019-nCoV, one could
also target the RNA genome itself for degradation. This RNA
genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was recently published (GenBank: MN908947.3), and one strategy that could be considered then, is the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) to combat the virus by targeting its RNA genome23. The challenge with this strategy is multifold. First, the conserved RNA sequence domains of CoV-2019
are not known. Identifying conserved sequences is essential in
order to optimize siRNA targeting and avoid viral escape of the
oligonucleotide strategy. One could look at genome homology
of 2019-nCoV to the SARS virus for comparison of
conserved sequences, but this would still be guesswork.
A second challenge is how the oligonucleotides would be
delivered into the lungs. Advances have been made into delivery vehicles such as lipid nanoparticles that can mediate some
delivery into the lungs24. It is unknown, however, if enough
siRNA’s or ASO’s would be effectively delivered within the
lungs to stop the infection or make a difference in its clinical
course. For example, if 25% of alveolar epithelial cells in the
lung had siRNA or ASO in them, that efficiency might be a
great success for traditional gene therapy, but would hardly
make any difference in a viral infection. Such an explanation

is also likely why siRNA candidates against Ebola failed in
trials25, despite significant success in preclinical animal models26,27.
Lastly, even if one assumed that siRNA was effective clinically, there is a limited ability to scale up manufacturing of
siRNA drugs to a large infected population. Current siRNA
and ASO therapies are manufactured for rare diseases, and
there are no available resources existing to manufacture the
medications quickly.

Repurposing currently available antiviral medications
Ideal agents to fight 2019-nCoV would be approved small molecule drugs that could inhibit different aspects of the viral life
cycle, ultimately inhibiting replication. Two classes of potential targets are viral polymerases28 and protease inhibitors29,
both of which are components of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral regimens.
Pilot clinical studies are already ensuing by desperate clinicians with various repurposed antiviral medicines. This has been
done in every viral outbreak previously with limited success,
outside of case reports30. Indeed, during the Ebola outbreak,
none of the repurposed small molecule drugs were definitively
shown to improve the clinical course across all patients31.
The 2019-nCoV could be different, and there are initial
positive reports that lopinavir and ritonavir, which are HIV protease inhibitors, have some clinical efficacy against 2019-nCoV,
similar to prior studies using them against SARS32. Research
should continue to be undertaken to screen other clinically available antivirals in cell culture models of 2019-nCoV, in hopes
that a drug candidate would emerge useful against the virus
that could be rapidly implemented in the clinic. One promising example could be remdesivir, which interferes with the viral
polymerase and has shown efficacy against MERS in mouse
models33. For further information, reviews of previous drug
repurposing efforts for coronaviruses are provided34,35. Though
these repurposed medications may hold promise, it is still
reasonable to pursue novel, 2019-nCoV specific therapies to
complement potential repurposed drug candidates.
Passive antibody transfer from convalescent patient sera
A simple but potentially very effective tool that can be used
in infectious outbreaks is to use the serum of patients who have
recovered from the virus to treat patients who contract the
virus in the future36. Patients with resolved viral infection will
develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different
viral antigens of 2019-nCoV. Some of these polyclonal antibodies will likely neutralize the virus and prevent new rounds
of infection, and the patients with resolved infection should
produce 2019-nCoV antibodies in high titer.
Patients with resolved cases of 2019-nCoV can simply donate
plasma, and then this plasma can be transfused into infected
patients37. Given that plasma donation is well established, and
the transfusion of plasma is also routine medical care, this
proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be put into place. Indeed, the same rationale
was used in the treatment of several Ebola patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014–2015, including
two American healthcare workers who became infected38.

F1000Research 2020, 9:72 Last updated: 03 APR 2020

As the outbreak continues, more patients who survived infection will become available to serve as donors to make antisera
for 2019-nCoV, and a sizeable stock of antisera could be developed to serve as a treatment for the sickest patients. Unfortunately, the exponential growth of the outbreak would work
against this strategy, since the growing number of cases would
likely outstrip the ability of previous patients to provide donor
plasma as treatment. Moreover, convalescent patient sera would
have significant variability in the potency of antiviral effect,
making it less ideal37. While transfusion medicine services
should certainly pursue convalescent patient sera as an option
right now for patient treatment, it is ultimately limited in its
effective scope of controlling the outbreak.

Proposal for new 2019-nCoV therapies
The simplest and most direct approach to combating
2019-nCoV during the outbreak would be one to neutralize
the virus from entering cells, the function that antibodies normally perform in the body39. For the reasons mentioned above
when discussing neutralizing antibodies, it will be difficult to
validate a broadly neutralizing antibody quickly, and a challenge
to make sure that the mutating RNA virus will not escape its
neutralization. A cocktail antibody approach could be undertaken as was explored to treat the Ebola pandemic40, but
would add complexity to the manufacturing process.
However, there is another strategy to pursue in this scenario
that does not rely on targeting the viral glycoprotein directly.
In this strategy, a neutralizing effect could be obtained by
targeting the viral receptor protein on the cell surface, thereby
blocking the virus from binding to it and gaining entry.
Fortunately, scientists have already uncovered the identity of
the viral receptor in cell culture. A recent pre-print publication
found that the 2019-nCoV uses the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry41, which is the
same receptor that the SARS coronavirus uses for entry42. For
both viruses, the coronavirus binds to ACE2 through its S protein
on the virion, where after fusion of the viral membrane and cell
membrane will occur. Subsequently, the RNA virus will replicate its genome inside the cell, and ultimately make new
virions that will be secreted to infect other cells. The coincidence of SARS and 2019-nCoV using ACE2 receptor opens
up the possibility of using the extensive research studied on
SARS entry and applying it to 2019-nCoV. Based on the
SARS literature, several potential blocking strategies could be
considered, which were shown to be effective in preventing
infection in SARS models.

Blocking agents that bind to ACE2 receptor
The first strategy would consist of administering to patients
an agent that would bind to ACE2. The key advantage here is
that the host ACE2 protein will not change, so there is no concern about escape from binding the therapeutic agent. Moreover,
the virus will not have the ability to mutate and bind an entirely
new host receptor in the time frame of this outbreak; such
functional relationships are established by evolution over
long periods. By analogy, the influenza virus changes the
mutations on its surface to escape antibody neutralization

every year, but it always focuses on using sialic acid on the
cell surface as an entry receptor43.
There are two known options for agents to bind to ACE2. The
first is using the small receptor-binding domain (RBD) from
the SARS S protein that has been shown to be the key domain
that binds the ACE2 receptor during entry44. Administration of this domain, 193 amino acids in size, has been shown to
effectively block the entry of SARS in cell culture44. It is well
within reason that SARS RBD could be given to patients,
thereby binding their ACE2 proteins on target cells, preventing infection (Figure 1). There is also the potential for the
equivalent RBD of 2019-nCoV to be produced and used as a
therapy as well. This strategy assumes SARS and 2019-nCoV
share the same binding site on ACE2, which is highly likely
given the similar ACE2 binding sites of SARS and NL63
coronavirus The small size of the therapy, similar in size in
nanobody domains from camelid antibodies, would enhance
the perfusion of the biologic into tissues to more effectively
bind to viral entry receptors45. In regards to the outbreak situation that is ongoing, the small protein facilitates the rapid production of the therapy in bacteria potentially, which would help
production yields19. Moreover, bacterial production would
allow RBD proteins to be produced in a wide range of production facilities today in China, which already has numerous
contract research organization operations46. Alternatively, the
RBD protein could be attached to an Fc fragment for extended
circulation, which was done for an equivalent 212 amino acid
domain from MERS. The MERS RBD-Fc fusion demonstrated
the ability to block viral infection toward cell receptors, as well
as to stimulate an immune response against that specific viral
domain in mice47. Of note, since the RBD-Fc fusion would
bind to normal cells, one would want to eliminate cytotoxic
Fc domain functions through mutations that eliminate Fc receptor
binding48.
A second, similar strategy would be to administer an antibody
that would bind to ACE2 protein, thereby preventing 2019nCoV infection (Figure 1). This strategy was shown to effectively block SARS entry and replication in experiments42.
While no ACE2 antibody sequences are published in literature indexes, monoclonal antibodies do exist and the associated
hybridoma sequences could be cloned in a matter of days.
There would be no concern for any viral escape from an
ACE2 binding antibody, which is an advantage over neutralizing approaches against the S protein. There are a couple of
design considerations when thinking about how to employ the
ACE2 antibody strategy. Any effector functions would need
to be removed from the Fc domain49, such that inflammation
would not be caused in different tissues expressing ACE2. This
would retain the long-half life endowed by the Fc domain without any of the side effects. The downside of including the Fc
domain is the need to use a more expensive mammalian cell production system to preserve proper glycosylation, which would
decrease the turnaround time for getting the drug to patients
in the outbreak scenario. Alternatively, one could just administer a single chain variable fragment (scFv) that binds to
ACE2. A nanobody or VHH domains from camelids are

Figure 1. Therapeutic agents that could be used to block 2019-nCoV from infecting cells. Target cells expressing ACE2 include lung and
gastrointestinal tissues in the human body. The large spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus binds to ACE2 on infected cells, leading
to cell entry. Three proposed strategies would block this interaction would abrogate infection. In the first, the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
of the spike protein from SARS or 2019-nCoV would be administered, thereby binding ACE2 and saturating available sites. Alternatively, an
antibody or single chain antibody fragment (scFv) could be administered against ACE2 to accomplish the same. A third strategy would target
the coronavirus virions directly by using the ACE2 extracellular domain as bait to bind to spike protein. An Fc domain fused to ACE2 would
facilitate prolonged circulation of the biologic (ACE2-Fc).

another option as well50,51. These could be produced in bacteria, and its small size would allow for rapid permeation into different tissues. The downside is the shorter half-life of these
molecules without the Fc domain.
There are several limitations to these two options. Regarding the SARS RBD strategy, the body would likely develop
an immune response to the SARS protein eventually, although
the key intervention period of infection to combat 2019-nCoV
would fall under this window of time, where after an immune
response for both viruses would develop. Alternatively, if one
were to use the homologous RBD from 2019-nCoV itself, this
immune response would likely be very advantageous since it
could yield both a blocking effect and a vaccination effect52. For

both strategies, the dose that would be needed to block ACE2
receptors in the body across different organs is unknown, and
as is the percentage of ACE2 receptors that would need to be
saturated in order to slow the infection. The number of ACE2
receptors in the body, which are found in lung and gastrointestinal organs along with vascular endothelial cells among other
tissues53, could ultimately prove prohibitive for this strategy.
Moreover, the turnover of the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface would also influence how often the therapeutic protein
would need to be administered. To solve this issue, one could
increase the concentration of anti-ACE2 therapy at the crucial
site of infection in the lungs, via local administration to lungs via
nebulization. Lastly, there is the possibility that binding
ACE2 directly could paradoxically worsen lung physiology

Page 6 of 15

F1000Research 2020, 9:72 Last updated: 03 APR 2020

and clinical symptoms. A study found that a fusion protein of
SARS RBD to Fc domain bound ACE2 in murine lung tissue
after administration, exacerbating alveolar edema via ACE2
interaction, which normally counteracts acute lung injury54.
This suggests that if one were use an ACE2 binding strategy, it would be best employed early during infection or as
a prophylaxis to block the initial viral infection. Ultimately,
clinical trials in patients would need to investigate these
potential issues.

ACE2 immunoadhesin strategy
A potentially more promising strategy would be to create an
antibody-like molecule that would bind to the coronavirus itself,
rather than shielding cells from being infected. For this strategy,
it is proposed to use a soluble version of the ACE2 receptor that
would bind to the S protein of 2019-nCoV thereby neutralizing
the virus (Figure 1). Again, the research on the SARS virus
suggests this strategy is potentially promising. Soluble ACE2
receptor was demonstrated to block the SARS virus from
infecting cells in culture42. The reported affinity of soluble
ACE2 for the SARS S protein was 1.70 nM, which is comparable to the affinities of monoclonal antibodies55; it is likely that
2019-nCoV has similar affinity for ACE2. In order to use ACE2
as a therapy to treat patients, it would be advisable to convert soluble ACE2 into an immunoadhesin format fused to an
immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), thereby extending
the lifespan of the circulating molecule, while also recruiting
effector functions of the immune system against the virus. While
not tested in an animal model, a previous study demonstrated
that an ACE2 extracellular domain fused to the human IgG1
domain (ACE2-NN-Ig) was effective in neutralizing SARS coronavirus in vitro, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 2 nM56.
This study provides evidence then that ACE2-Fc could similarly
inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro and potentially in patients.
An additional advantage of using ACE2 as a 2019-nCoV S protein neutralizing agent is that ACE2 administration could also
directly treat the pneumonia pathophysiology. A portion of
patients with SARS and 2019-nCoV infection develop pneumonia, which is characterized by pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1,2. The viruses may, in part,
cause ARDS through viral-induced ACE2 protein shedding and
ACE2 protein decreased expression, both of which are mediated by S protein binding54. Administration of recombinant
ACE2 protein has been shown to improve acute lung injury
through decreasing angiotensin II levels and the hormones
subsequent binding to angiotensin II type 1a receptor57. Recombinant ACE2 can also reduce ARDS in respiratory syncytial
virus58 and H5N1 influenza59 infection models. Based on these
promising preclinical studies, recombinant human ACE2
(rhACE2) was moved into clinical trials in order to treat ARDS
in critically ill patients. A phase I trial demonstrated rhACE2
was well tolerated with no effects seen on the cardiovascular system60. A phase II trial demonstrated on-target efficacy in
reducing Ang1-8 peptide levels, but did not show significant
modulation of respiratory parameters61. It remains to be seen
whether rhACE2 administration has the same clinical benefits in treating ARDS that have been seen in animal models,

and whether ACE2-Fc administration could alleviate ARDS
in 2019-nCoV patients.
The proposed therapy for 2019-nCoV patients would consist of the extracellular domain of the ACE2 protein fused to a
human immunoglobulin G Fc domain (Figure 2A). Studies have
shown that the ACE2 amino acids 18 – 615 appear to be sufficient for SARS S protein binding62, which also covers the
peptidase domain necessary for ACE2 enzymatic function. It is
possible a smaller portion of the extracellular ACE2 domain
would be adequate for S protein binding, although a smaller
version would lack enzyme activity beneficial in treating lung
injury. Further studies are needed to define the minimal ACE2
domain necessary for 2019-nCoV S protein binding to construct
even smaller ACE2-Fc proteins. While we do not know the
structure of the 2019-nCoV S protein or how it binds to the
ACE2 receptor yet, it is reasonable for now to assume that the
same ACE2 protein domains utilized by the SARS virus are also
bound by 2019-nCoV to infect cells.
The advantage of the Fc domain is endowing a longer-half life
of the drug, which could enable healthcare workers to potentially be given drug doses prophylactically before seeing
infected patients. Indeed, the half-life of recombinant ACE2 was
extended from less than two hours to over one week in mice
when formatted as a recombinant ACE2-Fc therapy in a study
evaluating treatment for hypertension63. One difference from
the prior blocking agent strategies is that the effector functions
of the Fc domain could be retained in this molecule, allowing
recruitment of dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer
cells through the CD16 receptor against viral particles or
infected cells. This may facilitate faster activation of the host
antiviral immune response and elimination of the virus, which
was illustrated in a SARS mouse model where Fc engaging
antibodies were more potent in eliminating SARS via activation of phagocytic cells compared to antibodies that neutralized
virus alone64. Overall, the ACE2-Fc fusion protein would
have many of the same benefits of a traditional neutralizing
antibody that would be sought as a treatment for the infection,
but represent one with maximal breadth and potency since the
2019-nCoV could not escape its neutralization, given the same
protein is also its receptor for cell entry. Indeed, it has been
shown that the pathogenicity of SARS versus the more mild
human coronavirus NL63 was related to a lower affinity of
NL63 for human ACE2 versus SARS, with NL63 S protein
reducing ACE2 levels less than SARS S protein65. Therefore,
if 2019-nCoV were to try to escape ACE2 neutralization via
decreasing affinity, it would mutate into a less pathogenic
virus. This is similar to the re-emergent SARS virus in
2003-2004, which had lower affinity for human ACE2 and
resulted in less severe infection and no secondary transmission66.
Thus, 2019-nCoV could be presented with an evolutionary trap when faced with potential ACE2-Fc therapy, leading
toward a more benign clinical course.
To give some additional support to the potential of a receptorimmunoadhesin being a potential antiviral strategy, it should
be noted that CD4-Fc or CD4-IgG was one of the early agents

of the human ACE2 protein (blue; UniProtKB - Q9BYF1). The sequence of the human immunoglobulin G isotype 1 constant region is provided
(green; UniProtKB - P01857). A secretion signal from a human immunoglobin heavy chain is provided (red; UniProtKB - A0A0C4DH39).

developed as a potential HIV medication67. The protein contained the first two domains of the CD4 receptor that are known
to bind gp120 on the surface of infected HIV cells. CD4-IgG
was shown to neutralize HIV in vitro, preventing infection. The
protein was also safe when administered in patients, although
only limited-to-mild clinical benefit was achieved68,69. Updated
enhanced versions of CD4-IgG have been developed that additionally have a small peptide derived from the co-receptor,
CCR5, enhancing affinity and giving even more potent
neutralizing activity, essentially 100% of HIV isolates and
making rhesus macaques resistant to multiple simian-human
immunodeficiency virus challenges70,71. While HIV and
2019-nCoV are very different viruses, with different cell types,
kinetics, and clinical courses, the previous results with HIV are
encouraging that this could be a therapeutic strategy for
2019-nCoV. If anything, 2019-nCoV is likely more amenable
to this neutralizing therapy given that the respiratory virus will

only cause an acute infection, unlike HIV, which causes chronic
infection in hosts with different cellular reservoirs.
One potential limitation of the ACE2-Fc strategy is that the
increase in levels of extracellular ACE2 could have unknown
effects on the body, particularly when elevated for a prolonged
time via Fc domain extended half-life. Small levels of extracellular ACE2 are already secreted by tissues, so the circulation of this extracellular domain would not be unprecedented72.
Moreover, recombinant ACE2 protein was well-tolerated by
healthy patients in a phase I trial, and by patients with lung injury
in a phase II trial, suggesting treating 2019-nCoV patients with
ACE2-Fc will also tolerated. If investigators are still concerned,
critical amino acid(s) for ACE2 peptidase activity could be
mutated to abolish the native function of this sequence, while
retaining high affinity binding for SARS and 2019-nCoV S protein. Indeed, this possibility was previously investigated in
Page 8 of 15

F1000Research 2020, 9:72 Last updated: 03 APR 2020

generating an ACE2 and IgG1 fusion protein, which showed
that mutation of histidine residues at position 374 and 378 of the
ACE2 extracellular domain abolished peptidase activity, but
retained high affinity binding to SARS S protein56. Of course,
ACE2 peptidase mutation would eliminate the beneficial effects
from the recombinant protein delivery of ACE2 in treating lung
injury, so it is recommended that retaining ACE2 enzyme activity be pursued first. Another potential concern is that receptor binding via an antibody format could inadvertently direct
2019-nCoV toward infecting Fc receptor (CD16) positive
cells, which has been shown in vitro for neutralizing antibodies in MERS73. It’s unclear what clinical significance this would
have, and to what extent this would happen in vivo. Ultimately,
clinical trials will be needed to delineate any specific side
effects of ACE2-Fc treatment.

Action plan and discussion
The chief objective of global health efforts against 2019-nCoV
remains to effectively quarantine patients and screen individuals who may be infected to limit spread. That objective should
continue going forward. What is proposed here is an option
to at least give infected patients a medication quickly to help
alleviate symptoms and prevent death, while vaccine efforts for
2019-nCoV continue. This could be enabled through ACE2-Fc
providing a triple mechanism of action: (1) Treatment of
ACE2 deficiency and lung injury, (2) virus neutralization, and
(3) immune effector recruitment. Beyond infected patients,
ACE2-Fc could provide passive immunity to healthcare works
at risk as another benefit. Going forward, it is recommended
that physicians, scientists, and biotech industry in China
and elsewhere pursue manufacturing an ACE2-Fc biologic
agent right now, which can immediately advance into trials.
A variety of different protein expression platforms (CHO, insect,
yeast) could be utilized, depending on the particular contract
manufacturer’s expertise. Gene therapy could even be considered to make ACE2-Fc from a DNA or mRNA platform,
but would have additional risk of uncertain delivery strategies
and ultimately may slow down progress toward treating patients.
The goal would be that ACE2-Fc could treat infection in current patients preventing significant morbidities and death,
while also serving as a potential prophylactic to give passive
immunity to clinical providers on the frontlines, as well as individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. Essentially,
ACE2-Fc could be the potent neutralizing antibody that the global health community needs to combat 2019-nCoV, today, while
also treating the underlying ARDS pathophysiology causing patient mortality. It could be scaled much more quickly
than convalescent patient sera, which would be dependent on
infected individuals to make. ACE2-Fc would be resistant to
viral escape as well, unlike potential neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies that may be developed in the coming weeks to months.
While a therapeutic strategy is being outlined here, the longterm goal of 2019-nCoV research would remain developing an effective vaccine to yield neutralizing antibodies, likely
based on the S protein and specifically, the RBD protein. Such
trials should happen as soon as possible, but may prove to be
challenging to get the right level of immunogenicity, antigen

presentation, adjuvant addition, and potent antibody stimulation. The virus could continue mutating, foiling different efforts to stimulate protective immunity. By comparison,
2019-nCoV cannot escape the ACE2-Fc treatment strategy,
since it leverages its own cognate receptor for infection. As
mentioned above, should 2019-nCoV attempt to escape this
therapy via reduced ACE2 affinity binding, it would likely
become less pathogenic, similar to the comparison of SARS
versus human coronavirus NL6365. Lastly, scaling the dose
of any effective vaccine would also prove to be challenging
depending on the vector format (e.g. viral vector versus mRNA
versus protein), and even a fully protective vaccine would
not help patients who are currently infected with the virus.
In an effort to help aide researchers and industry in China to
combat 2019-nCoV, the protein sequence of the ACE2-Fc
construct is provided (Figure 2B). Different human Fc
domains (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) could be contemplated,
although IgG1 traditionally has the most potency for triggering
anti-microbial responses49. Similarly, an ACE2-Fc biologic
without active ACE2 peptidase function could be explored as
well. Given that gene synthesis of this sequence could happen
within a week, the gene could be placed within the protein
expression platform of choice shortly thereafter leading to protein production quickly. The availability of protein A columns
and other techniques in the industry to purify antibodies would
facilitate ACE2-Fc to quickly be repurposed on existing antibody
manufacturing infrastructure existing in China.
A final benefit of pursuing ACE2-Fc is that it could
effectively be used as a therapeutic drug stockpile for future
outbreaks of SARS and 2019-nCoV, and any new coronavirus that emerges from a zoonotic reservoir in the future that
uses the ACE2 receptor for entry. Moreover, coronaviruses that
replicate in animals across China and other countries could
be studied in order to assess their entry mechanisms. By
understanding entry in these other animals, one could effectively
predict a receptor that could be utilized in any zoonotic transmission event, and build a new receptor immunoadhesin molecule in the future. As an example, a similar immunoadhesin,
DPP4-Fc, could be envisioned for MERS based on the viral
receptor, DPP4, used by that virus74. Beyond coronaviruses,
this strategy could be utilized for other viruses where the risk
of outbreak potential is high. ACE2-Fc could also find use in
treating ARDS for other unrelated viruses and causes of acute lung
injury, building on the previous clinical trial work60,61.
In summary, ACE2-Fc has the potential to be the neutralizing antibody that healthcare workers need to treat and prevent
2019-nCoV infection today and could play an important role
in the cessation of the outbreak if manufacturing based on
an available sequence starts soon. An alternative 2019-nCoV
RBD-Fc fusion could also be pursued, if one desired the
dual function of receptor blocking and vaccination in one
molecule.

A very sensible opinion article based on information well known to the coronavirus field but perhaps not
well appreciated by others who might want to address this potential pandemic.
I found no factual or interpretive errors. Were the issue not so pressing, I might have somewhat
discounted the article based on 'obviousness' but this is obviousness to the field and not to the wider
group of readers.
Is the topic of the opinion article discussed accurately in the context of the current literature?
Yes
Are all factual statements correct and adequately supported by citations?
Yes
Are arguments sufficiently supported by evidence from the published literature?
Yes
Are the conclusions drawn balanced and justified on the basis of the presented arguments?
Yes
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.
Reviewer Expertise: Viral entry, coronavirus virus receptors and S protein, use of receptors as entry
inhibitors
We confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of
expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.

This review provide an authoritative review on 2019-nCoV infection therapeutic options. After briefly
covered several treatment strategies, the author focused on options to block virus from entering cells.
Figure 1 is terrific.
1. I suggest that the authors provide a table contrasting the four strategies mentioned at the
beginning.
2. In the treatment involving neutralizing antibodies, the author should discuss potential side effect
such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).
3. So many therapeutic options have been mentioned in China including Chinese herbs and
chlorquine. It will be great if the author can briefly review and comment on this.

Regarding the oligopeptide section, what about the hexapeptide YKYRYL? It binds exactly to the
spike-ACE2 binding domain and is so much smaller.
