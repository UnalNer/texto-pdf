Recent publications have brought attention to the possible beneﬁt of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial
drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientiﬁc
community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the ﬁeld of
antiviral research.

Recent publications have brought attention to the possible beneﬁt of
chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Colson
et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020). The scientiﬁc community should consider
this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in
the ﬁeld of antiviral research.
The sulfate and phosphate salts of chloroquine have both been
commercialised as antimalarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine has also
been used as an antimalarial, but in addition is now broadly used in
autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of note,
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered to be safe and
side-eﬀects are generally mild and transitory. However, the margin
between the therapeutic and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine
poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be
life-threatening (Frisk-Holmberg et al., 1983). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use should therefore be subject to strict rules, and
self-treatment is not recommended.
The in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been identiﬁed
since the late 1960's (Inglot, 1969; Miller and Lenard, 1981; Shimizu
et al., 1972) and the growth of many diﬀerent viruses can be inhibited
in cell culture by both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, including
the SARS coronavirus (Keyaerts et al., 2004). Some evidence for activity
in mice has been found for a variety of viruses, including human coronavirus OC43 (Keyaerts et al., 2009), enterovirus EV-A71 (Tan et al.,
2018), Zika virus (Li et al., 2017) and inﬂuenza A H5N1 (Yan et al.,
2013). However, chloroquine did not prevent inﬂuenza infection in a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Paton et al.,
2011), and had no eﬀect on dengue-infecteds patient in a randomized
controlled trial in Vietnam (Tricou et al., 2010). Chloroquine was also
active ex vivo but not in vivo in the case of ebolavirus in mice (Dowall
et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2015), Nipah (Pallister et al., 2009) and
inﬂuenza virus (Vigerust and McCullers, 2007) in ferrets.
The case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is of speciﬁc interest:
chloroquine showed promising antiviral activity in vitro (Coombs et al.,
1981; Delogu and de Lamballerie, 2011), but was shown to enhance
alphavirus replication in various animal models (Maheshwari et al.,
1991; Roques et al., 2018; Seth et al., 1999), most probably because of
the immune modulation and anti-inﬂammatory properties of chloroquine in vivo (Connolly et al., 1988; Katz and Russell, 2011; Savarino
et al., 2003). In a nonhuman primate model of CHIKV infection,
chloroquine treatment was shown to exacerbate acute fever and delay
the cellular immune response, leading to an incomplete viral clearance
(Roques et al., 2018). A clinical trial conducted during the chikungunya
outbreak in 2006 in Réunion Island showed that oral chloroquine
treatment did not improve the course of the acute disease (De
Lamballerie et al., 2008) and that chronic arthralgia on day 300 postillness was more frequent in treated patients than in the control group
(Roques et al., 2018). Altogether, the assessment of previous trials indicates that, to date, no acute virus infection has been successfully
treated by chloroquine in humans.
Chloroquine has also been tested in chronic viral diseases. Its use in
the treatment of HIV-infected patients has been considered inconclusive
(Chauhan and Tikoo, 2015) and the drug has not been included in the
panel recommended for HIV treatment. The only modest eﬀect of
chloroquine in the therapy of human virus infection was found for
chronic hepatitis C: an increase of the early virological response to
pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Helal et al., 2016) and, in a small
sample size pilot trial in non-responder HCV patients, a transient viral
load reduction (Peymani et al., 2016) were observed. This was not
enough to include chloroquine in the standardised therapeutic
