Recent publications have brought attention to the possible beneﬁt of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial
drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientiﬁc
community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the ﬁeld of
antiviral research.

Recent publications have brought attention to the possible beneﬁt of
chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Colson
et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020). The scientiﬁc community should consider
this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in
the ﬁeld of antiviral research.
The sulfate and phosphate salts of chloroquine have both been
commercialised as antimalarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine has also
been used as an antimalarial, but in addition is now broadly used in
autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of note,
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered to be safe and
side-eﬀects are generally mild and transitory. However, the margin
between the therapeutic and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine
poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be
life-threatening (Frisk-Holmberg et al., 1983). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use should therefore be subject to strict rules, and
self-treatment is not recommended.
The in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been identiﬁed
since the late 1960's (Inglot, 1969; Miller and Lenard, 1981; Shimizu
et al., 1972) and the growth of many diﬀerent viruses can be inhibited
in cell culture by both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, including
the SARS coronavirus (Keyaerts et al., 2004). Some evidence for activity
in mice has been found for a variety of viruses, including human coronavirus OC43 (Keyaerts et al., 2009), enterovirus EV-A71 (Tan et al.,
2018), Zika virus (Li et al., 2017) and inﬂuenza A H5N1 (Yan et al.,
2013). However, chloroquine did not prevent inﬂuenza infection in a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Paton et al.,
2011), and had no eﬀect on dengue-infecteds patient in a randomized
controlled trial in Vietnam (Tricou et al., 2010). Chloroquine was also
active ex vivo but not in vivo in the case of ebolavirus in mice (Dowall

∗

et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2015), Nipah (Pallister et al., 2009) and
inﬂuenza virus (Vigerust and McCullers, 2007) in ferrets.
The case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is of speciﬁc interest:
chloroquine showed promising antiviral activity in vitro (Coombs et al.,
1981; Delogu and de Lamballerie, 2011), but was shown to enhance
alphavirus replication in various animal models (Maheshwari et al.,
1991; Roques et al., 2018; Seth et al., 1999), most probably because of
the immune modulation and anti-inﬂammatory properties of chloroquine in vivo (Connolly et al., 1988; Katz and Russell, 2011; Savarino
et al., 2003). In a nonhuman primate model of CHIKV infection,
chloroquine treatment was shown to exacerbate acute fever and delay
the cellular immune response, leading to an incomplete viral clearance
(Roques et al., 2018). A clinical trial conducted during the chikungunya
outbreak in 2006 in Réunion Island showed that oral chloroquine
treatment did not improve the course of the acute disease (De
Lamballerie et al., 2008) and that chronic arthralgia on day 300 postillness was more frequent in treated patients than in the control group
(Roques et al., 2018). Altogether, the assessment of previous trials indicates that, to date, no acute virus infection has been successfully
treated by chloroquine in humans.
Chloroquine has also been tested in chronic viral diseases. Its use in
the treatment of HIV-infected patients has been considered inconclusive
(Chauhan and Tikoo, 2015) and the drug has not been included in the
panel recommended for HIV treatment. The only modest eﬀect of
chloroquine in the therapy of human virus infection was found for
chronic hepatitis C: an increase of the early virological response to
pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Helal et al., 2016) and, in a small
sample size pilot trial in non-responder HCV patients, a transient viral
load reduction (Peymani et al., 2016) were observed. This was not
enough to include chloroquine in the standardised therapeutic

protocols for hepatitis C patients.
Recently, Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2020) evaluated in vitro
ﬁve FDA-approved drugs and two broad spectrum antivirals against a
clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. One of their conclusions was that
"chloroquine (is) highly eﬀective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection
in vitro" and that its "safety track record suggests that it should be assessed in human patients suﬀering from the novel coronavirus disease".
At least 16 diﬀerent trials for SARS-CoV-2 already registered in the

COVID-19 ("Chinese Clinical Trial Register" (ChiCTR)). In a recent
publication (Gao et al., 2020), Gao and colleagues indicate that, "according to the news brieﬁng", "results from more than 100 patients have
demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control
treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung
imaging ﬁndings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course".
This would represent the ﬁrst successful use of chloroquine in humans for the treatment of an acute viral disease, and is undoubtedly
excellent news, since this drug is cheap and widely available. However,
it should be considered carefully before drawing deﬁnitive conclusions,
since no data has been provided yet to support this announcement.
Results were produced in ten diﬀerent hospitals and possibly from a
number of diﬀerent clinical protocols among those listed above, which
include various designs for control groups (none, diﬀerent antivirals,
placebo, etc.) and various outcome primary indicators. The ﬁnal interpretation is therefore technically demanding, and in the absence of
published data, it is diﬃcult to reach any ﬁrm conclusion. It will be of
the utmost importance to know if the observed eﬃcacy is associated
speciﬁcally with chloroquine phosphate, or if this includes other salts
(e.g., sulfate) of chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. It is also necessary to determine if the beneﬁt of chloroquine therapy depends on
the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease.
In conclusion, the option of using chloroquine in the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 should be examined with attention in light of the recent
promising announcements, but also of the potential detrimental eﬀect
of the drug observed in previous attempts to treat acute viral diseases.
We urge Chinese scientists to report the interim trial results currently
running in China as soon as they are available. This should be preferentially done in a peer-reviewed publication with detailed information to allow the international scientiﬁc community to analyse the results, to conﬁrm in prospective trials the eﬃcacy of the proposed
treatment and to guide future clinical practice.
