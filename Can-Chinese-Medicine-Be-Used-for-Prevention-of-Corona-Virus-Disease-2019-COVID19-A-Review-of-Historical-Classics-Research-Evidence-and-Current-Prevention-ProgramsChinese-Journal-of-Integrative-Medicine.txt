Objective:: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in


Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending
Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed
Methods:: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in
ancient classics and human studies. Methods
CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1
inﬂuenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were
retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from
clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases.
Results: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice
Results
cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3
studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 inﬂuenza. None of the participants who took CM
contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 inﬂuenza in the CM group was significantly lower than
the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24–0.52; n =4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23
provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external
pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included
Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis
Conclusions::
Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). Conclusions
Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal
formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous
population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

In December 2019, a pneumonia associated
with the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. (1) It is
highly contagious and has quickly spread to many other
parts of China and some other countries within 1 month
since the first report emerged. As of February 11, 2020,
44,653 cases of confirmed infections and 1,113 deaths
have been reported in Chinese mainland.(2) Outside
of China, there had been 395 confirmed cases and 1
death from 24 countries were reported as of February
11, 2020.(3) The outbreak of COVID-19 raised intense
attention not only within China but internationally.(4) On
20 January 2020, the Chinese government added it to
the Notifiable Communicable Disease List and gave
the highest priority to its prevention and treatment.(5)
On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization

(WHO) declared a public health emergency of
international concern for China's COVID-19.
Although the WHO said: "To date, there is no
specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the
novel coronavirus",(6) in China, historically, when the
outbreak started, Chinese medicine (CM) approaches
including oral administration of preventive herbal
formulae, wearing CM sachets, indoor herbal medicine
fumigation, etc. were recommended for prevention and
treatment.(7,8) For example, in 2003, CM approaches
were used to prevent and treat severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS),(9,10) which was the most serious
infectious disease outbreak in China prior to the
COVID-19. In 2009, during the pandemic of H1N1
inﬂuenza around the world, the National Administration
of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China issued a CM
prevention program, which included 4 Chinese herbal
medicine (CHM) formulae for adults of different CM
body constitutions and one for children.(11) The current
outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in many provinces in
China issuing CM prevention and control programs,
among which the prevention programs are mainly oral
CHM formulae. This study has reviewed the historical
and human research evidence on CM in preventing and
control of infections in order to provide guidance for the
prevention of COVID-19.
