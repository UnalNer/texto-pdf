Background: Since the ﬁrst case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected
in Wuhan, China, a series of conﬁrmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the
data of 262 conﬁrmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in
Beijing.
Methods: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID19 virus, diagnostic classiﬁcation, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the
characteristics between severe and common conﬁrmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia
cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.
Findings: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service.
Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including
192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The
median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of
Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with conﬁrmed cases, 21
(10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%),
cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was
6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10,
17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19
infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
Interpretation: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe
cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at
early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and
quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed on Feb 10, 2020, using the terms
“2019-nCoV” and “characteristics” for articles in English. We
found six studies on the characteristics of patients infected
with COVID-19. Huang C reported the features of 41 cases in
Wuhan in the Lancet on Jan 24, 21,020. Li Q reported the dynamics of 425 cases in Wuhan in the New England Journal
Medicine on Jan 29,2020. Chen N reported characteristics of
99 cases in Wuhan in the Lancet on Jan 30, 21,020.Wang D
reported characteristics of 138 cases in Wuhan in the JAMA
on Feb 7, 2020. Other two studies were case reports. Our
search did not reveal any report on the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 infection in other imported city except
Wuhan.
Added value of this study
We reported the characteristics of 262 cases infected with
COVID-19 from 57 hospitals across Beijing and provided the
proportion of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to
mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases. We compared
the epidemic features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS for
learn lessons and control the outbreak.
Implications of all the available evidence
The COVID-19 infection was generally susceptible, and
with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent
transmission was very successful at early stage, the next
steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early
isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing and China.

to Feb 10, 2020. We compared the characteristics between severe and common conﬁrmed cases which including mild cases,
no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases. The features were
compared between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Beijing Emergency Medical Center
(No.2020-01) and the written informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study and belongs to emergency medical service.

A conﬁrmed case was deﬁned as a suspected case with the laboratory test for the COVID-19 from the respiratory specimens show
positive result by the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, while a suspected case was deﬁned
as a case that fulﬁlled both the following criteria: have fever, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, low or normal white-cell count
or low lymphocyte count in clinic; and have a travel to Wuhan or
direct contact with patients from Wuhan who have fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days before illness in the epidemic
history according to the new coronavirus pneumonial prevention
and control program, and the new coronavirus pneumonial diagnosis and treatment program which were published by the National
Health Commission of China.8–10
A mild case was deﬁned as a conﬁrmed case with fever, respiratory symptoms and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, while
a severe case was deﬁned as a mild case with dyspnea or respiratory failure. A non-pneumonia case was deﬁned as a conﬁrmed
case with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, but no radiographic
evidence of pneumonia, while an asymptomatic case was deﬁned
as a conﬁrmed case with normal body temperature or minor discomfort.

As of February 10, 2020, a total of 40,554 cases with laboratoryconﬁrmed COVID-19 infection have been detected in the world
reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 There have
been 42,638 accumulated conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 infections,
of them 1016 patients has died, 3996 have been discharged and
88% remain in hospital in mainland of China,2 and 342 conﬁrmed
cases were found in Beijing.3 The infected cases were also reported
in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, the US, and
other 24 countries around the world.4–5 Given that the current
COVID-19 outbreak is moving rapidly, the recently published literatures on the epidemic features of COVID-19 mainly focus on
Wuhan, China,6–7 but the information on the imported city or region is exceedingly rare.
In this study, we provide an analysis of data on the characteristics of patients with conﬁrmed COVID-19 infection throughout Beijing as an imported metropolis, and unravel the proportion on the
severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases.
Additionally, Beijing experienced the outbreak of SARS in 2003. For
learn lessons and control the outbreak, we compare the epidemic
features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.

We modiﬁed the medical record form for the COVID-19 infection, which including demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19, diagnostic classiﬁcation, cluster case
and outcome etc. Laboratory conﬁrmation of COVID-19 was detected in the ﬁrst admission hospital and veriﬁed by the Beijing
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Clinical outcomes
were followed up to February 10, 2020. If the data missing from
the records was needed, we obtained data by direct communication with EMS providers. A double-extraction method in which
two independent reviewers extract data and evaluate the eligibility of the original data was applied. All differences were resolved through discussion prior to the ﬁnal analysis. All data were
checked by another two researchers.
Data on the COVID-19 infection in China and Beijing obtained
from National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China
and Beijing Health Commission respectively between Jan 20 to Feb
10, 2020. The data of SARS in 2003 searched from the oﬃce of the
Ministry of Health, which started on April 21, 2003, both including
accumulative and daily new conﬁrmed cases of the SARS outbreak
in China.
