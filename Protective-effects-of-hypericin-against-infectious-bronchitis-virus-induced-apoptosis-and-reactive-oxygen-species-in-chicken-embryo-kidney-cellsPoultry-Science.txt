ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),
a coronavirus, causes infectious bronchitis leading to
enormous economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide. Hypericin (HY) is an excellent compound that
has been investigated in antiviral, antineoplastic, and
antidepressant. To investigate the inhibition effect of
HY on IBV infection in chicken embryo kidney (CEK)
cells, 3 different experimental designs: pre-treatment
of cells prior to IBV infection, direct treatment of
IBV-infected cells, and pre-treatment of IBV prior to
cell infection were used. Quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy were performed
and virus titer was determined by TCID50 . The re-

sults revealed that HY had a good anti-IBV effect
when HY directly treated the IBV-infected cells, and
virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HY inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis in CEK cells, and significantly reduced the mRNA
expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase
3, and Caspase 8, and significantly increased Bcl-2
mRNA expression level in CEK cells. In addition, HY
treatment could decrease IBV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in CEK cells. These
results suggested that HY showed potential antiviral activities against IBV infection involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK
cells.

INTRODUCTION
Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member
of the Coronaviridae family (Cook et al., 2012), causes
mild-to-acute respiratory disease in chickens (Benyeda
et al., 2009; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). IBV infects chickens via the respiratory tract, from which it
can spread to other epithelial tissues. Therefore, IBV
not only injures the respiratory tract, but also causes
damage to the digestive system and urogenital system,
such as the proventriculus, kidney, ovary, and oviduct,
resulting in respiratory disease, interstitial nephritis,
and dysplasia of the oviduct (Zhong et al., 2016). IBV
has led to severe economic losses in the poultry industry
worldwide. It has been demonstrated that IBV not only
causes direct loss due to high mortality, secondary bac© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.

terial infection, poor meat production, and egg quality,
but also indirect losses arises from increasing drug costs
and vaccination in IBV prevention (Liang et al., 2019).
There are multiple known strains of IBV, and increasing numbers of variants have emerged continuous
recombinations, resulting in more diversified and complicated genotypes and serotypes (Feng et al., 2015;
Laconi et al., 2019). Because of poor vaccine cross
protection among different virus serotypes, it makes
difficult to prevent and control IBV infection with the
current precautionary measures (Mo et al., 2013; Yan
et al., 2018). Thus, finding effective antiviral drugs
or agents is imperative for alternative approach to
prevent IBV infection.
The Chinese government has prohibited the use of antiviral drugs in food animals. Thus, utilization of traditional herbs remains a major focus in antiviral research.
Several reports have confirmed that traditional Chinese
herbs could effectively inhibit the replication of various
viruses (Chen et al., 2018; Dziewulska et al., 2018; Lv
et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2017). Hypericin (HY), a natural

polycyclic quinone, is mainly extracted from St John’s
Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) (Barnes et al., 2019).
Hypericin has traditionally been used in a wide range
of medical applications such as anti-virus (Birt et al.,
2009; Marrelli et al., 2014; Naesens et al., 2006; Wolfle
et al., 2014), anti-tumor (Mirmalek et al., 2015), and
anti-depressant (Zhai et al., 2015). Hypericin has virucidal activity against both DNA and RNA viruses with
lipid envelope (Tang et al., 1990), suggesting that HY
has the potential to be developed and used as antiviral
drugs. In particular, HY has been found to have significant inhibitory effect on HIV infection (Taher et al.,
2002). Recent studies on the use of HY for inhibiting
hepatitis C virus (HCV) have attracted more attention (Jacobson et al., 2001; Shih et al., 2018). Hepatitis C virus infection could induce oxidative stress
and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which enhanced the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoted caspase 3 activity, and finally led to hepatocyte injury in vivo and in vitro (Ríos-Ocampo et al.,
2019).
Similar to HCV, IBV is also an enveloped singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus, whether HY has
the likely inhibitory effect on IBV has not been explored. The aim of this study is to elucidate the antiviral activity and related mechanism of HY inhibiting
IBV replication in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells,
and provide alternative approach to prevent and treat
IBV infection. The impact of HY on relative mRNA
expression levels of IBV, apoptosis-related genes (including Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 3, and
Caspase 8), and ROS production in IBV-infected CEK
cells were studied. Our results clearly demonstrated HY
had potential antiviral activities against IBV infection
involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK cells.

Primary cultures of CEK cells from 18-day-old SPF
chicken embryos (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS) were prepared according to standard
techniques. The cells were cultured in M199 medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO2 to allow the formation of cell monolayers in cell culture plates.

Reagents and Antibodies
Hypericin powder (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with purity
99% was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. A total of 20 mg HY was pre-dissolved
in 500 µL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) and then
added 4.5 mL M199 medium as HY stock solution, in
which HY concentration is 4,000 µg/mL, and DMSO
concentration is 10% (V/V). The stock solution of
HY (4.0 mg/mL) was stored at −20°C in the dark.
Ribavirin (RT, H51023508) was from Sichuan Biokin
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). N-Acetyl
cysteine (NAC) and 2 7 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Annexin V-FITC kit was purchased from
Shanghai Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). The apoptosis promoter PAC-1 (MCE, Brea,
CA, USA) and anti-apoptotic Z-VAD-FMK (MCE,
Brea, CA, USA) were prepared into 10 mM solution
with DMSO and stored at −20°C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated affiniPure goat anti-rabbit
IgG was purchased from Zhongshan Company (Beijing,
China). Anti-IBV polyclonal antibody was prepared
and kept in Veterinary Pathology Laboratory, College
of Veterinary Medicine of Northeast Agricultural University, which could specifically react with IBV.

Cytotoxicity Assay
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus and Cell Cultures
Experimental procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of Northeast
Agricultural University (Number SRM-08). All animal
studies were complied with the animal experiment
guidelines of the Animal Experimentation Ethics
Committee of Northeast Agricultural University.
The IBV M41 strain was kept at Veterinary
Pathology Lab, College of Veterinary Medicine,
Northeast Agricultural University, and propagated in 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF)
chicken embryos (Harbin Veterinary Research
Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences).
The allantoic fluid of infected embryos was harvested
at 72 h post inoculation, and confirmed no other
pathogens detected with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and bacterial culture,
and finally stored at −80°C until use.

The cytotoxicity assays were performed according to published 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) protocols with
minor modifications (Sui et al., 2010). Cell monolayers
plated onto 96-well culture plates were washed 3 times
with D-Hanks solution. Hypericin at concentrations
of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 µg/mL
were added onto the wells (3 wells per each dilution). Control cells were incubated with the same
corresponding concentrations of DMSO solutions as
negative controls. The cells were cultured at 37°C for
48 h, and the supernatant was taken out and washed
3 times with D-Hanks solution, then 20 µL of MTT
solution (5 mg/mL in M199 medium) was added to
each well and incubated for 4 h at 37˚C. After washing
with D-Hanks solution, 200 µL of DMSO was added to
each well. The plates were shaken gently for 15 min to
dissolve the formazan precipitate, and the OD570 was
recorded. Cell survival rates were calculated from mean
values according to the following equation: (OD570
drug)/(OD570 control) × 100%.

Figure 1. Effect of HY on the viability of CEK cells. (A) Trypan blue staining was used to assess cell viability. The 25 and 12.5 µg/mL
HY-treated CEK cells and the control CEK cells were stained with trypan blue. Cells not stained with trypan blue are considered viable. (B)
Cell viability was determined by MTT colorimetric assay. The survival rates of CEK cells was given at different concentrations of HY, and cell
survival rates of more than 50% (above the dotted line) was considered to be the maximum non-toxic concentration of HY. CEK = chicken
embryo kidney; HY = hypericin. Data are expressed as mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments (t-test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).

Antiviral Activity Assays
Pre-treatment of Cells Prior to IBV Infection To
analyze the impact of HY on cell to inhibit IBV infection, the CEK cells cultured on 96-well plates were
treated with continuous multiple dilutions of HY solutions in serum-free M199 medium, at 37˚C for 1 h and
then washed 3 times with D-Hanks solution. The cells

were subsequently infected with IBV (100 TCID50 ) and
cultured at 37˚C for 30 h. The cell samples were repeatedly frozen and thawed 3 times, extracted to obtain
total RNAs, and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The
relative mRNA expression levels of IBV N gene was
detected with quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRTPCR). In addition, the virus titer of the cell samples
was determined by TCID50 according to conventional

6370

CHEN ET AL.

TCID50 IBV was incubated with continuous multiple dilutions of HY solutions at 37˚C for 1 h. The HY-treated
IBV was subsequently used to infect CEK cells at 37˚C
for 30 h. As described above, the relative mRNA expression levels of IBV N gene and virus titer were detected.

Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)
In the above 3 experimental designs, the best way of
antiviral effect of HY on IBV was selected, and IBV
multiplication in CEK cells was detected with indirect
immunofluorescence assay (IFA). After washing with DHanks solution, the 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 µg/mL of HY
directly treated IBV-infected cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by quenching with
0.1% glycine in PBS and 1% Triton-X100 for 10 min.
After washing, the cells were incubated with rabbit
anti-IBV antibody (1:200) for 1 h followed by incubation with fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:500) for 30 min in the dark. The fluorescent images were examined under a Ti-S fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Additionally, 10 µg/mL
RT-treated CEK cells after IBV infection, IBV-infected
CEK cells, and mock CEK cells were detected as controls.

treatment of IBV-infected cells, and pre-treatment IBV prior to cell
infection, the relative mRNA expression levels of IBV-N gene (2A) and
the virus titer (2B) were detected, respectively. IBV-infected CEK cells
and 10 μg/mL RT-treated CEK cells after IBV infection were included
as controls. CEK = chicken embryo kidney; HY = hypericin; RT = ribavirin. Data are expressed as mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments

procedures. Meanwhile, the 10 µg/mL RT-treated cells
after IBV infection and IBV-infected CEK cells were
processed as controls.
Direct Treatment of IBV-infected Cells To determine the effect of HY on IBV-infected cells, the CEK
cells cultured on 96-well plates were infected with 100
TCID50 IBV for 1 h at 37˚C, and then treated with continuous multiple dilutions of HY solutions at 37˚C for
30 h. According to the above description, the relative
mRNA expression levels of IBV N gene and virus titer
were detected.

investigate direct effects of HY on the virus, 100

In total, 2 approaches were used to evaluate the effect of HY on cell apoptosis as described previously
(Singh et al., 2019). In brief, 100 TCID50 IBV-infected
CEK cells treated with 12.5 µg/mL HY were cultured
at 37°C for 30 h. Then, the apoptotic cells were analyzed using an Annexin V-FITC kit as described previously (Leber et al., 2018). The 20 µM PAC-1-treated
CEK cells, 20 µM Z-VAD-FMK-treated CEK cells followed with IBV infection, IBV-infected CEK cells, and
mock CEK cells were prepared and assayed concurrently. Moreover, flow cytometry was used to quantify
the number of Annexin V and propidium iodide-stained
cells among different experimental groups. In brief, the
IBV-Infected cells were treated with 12.5 µg/mL HY
as above and trypsinated. The viable cells determined
with trypan blue staining were adjusted to a final density of 4 × 105 cells/mL. Then the cells were incubated
with FITC-conjugated anti-Annexin V antibody and
propidium iodide for 15 min in the dark prior to flow
cytometry analysis. The IBV-infected CEK cells and
mock CEK cells were tested as controls.

RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription
The total RNAs of different experimental groups
were extracted using a Universal RNA Extraction Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All the
concentrations and the A260/A280 ratios of extracted RNA samples were measured using NanoDrop
2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

Waltham, MA, USA), and agarose gel electrophoresis
was used to assay the integrity of the extracted RNA.
The total RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNAs
using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo (dT) (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China)
with PCR instrument (TaKaRa, Japan) and stored at
−20°C for the following qRT-PCR assay.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
The mRNA expression levels of target genes were
determined, including IBV N gene, Fas, FasL, JNK,
Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8 with an applied
LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Schlieren, Switzerland). All primers
pairs used for qRT-PCR detection are listed in Table 1.
These primers were synthesized by the Genewiz Biological Technology Co., Ltd (Suzhou, China). The relative
expression ratios of target genes were calculated using
the 2−ΔΔCt method (Yu et al., 2017).
The amplification reaction was conducted containing
2 µL of cDNA, 0.6 µL of each of the forward and reverse primers, 10 µL universal SYBR Green (ROX), and
3.4 µL nuclease free water for a final volume of 20 µL
for each reaction. The following thermal profile for the
qRT-PCR assays was used in all the primer sets: preincubation 1 cycles at 95°C for 600 s, followed by 2 step
amplification: 42 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for
30 s, followed by melting: 1 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 65°C

for 60 s and 97°C for 1 s, followed by cooling 1 cycles
at 37°C for 30 s.

Detection of Intracellular ROS Production
2 7 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe was used to
measure the intracellular ROS scavenging activity of
HY in IBV-infected cells (Chavez and Pietras, 2018).
Briefly, the CEK cells were pre-incubated with IBV
for 1 h, followed by incubation with 3.125, 6.25, and
12.5 µg/mL HY for 30 h. The medium was removed and
the cells were washed with PBS. Then, the medium containing 10 μM DCFH-DA was added for 30 min at 37°C.
After washing with PBS, cells were photographed using
a Ti-S fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
And the CEK cells were pre-treated with 1.5 mM NAC
before IBV infection as control.

Statistical Analysis
The number of the experiment repetition in all the
experiment was 3 times. The experimental data was
analyzed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL). The results were expressed as the means ± standard deviation. Differences between groups were evaluated using the one-way analysis of variance of two-tailed
test. P-values of < 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant, and P-values of < 0.01 were considered as
highly significant.

RESULTS
Evaluation of Cytotoxicity of HY
The cell viability indicated by Trypan blue staining
was observed under an optical microscope, and further confirmed by MTT assays. The results showed
that the maximum nontoxic concentration of HY was
12.5 μg/mL. Trypan blue staining showed that cells
survived below 12.5 μg/mL of HY (Figure 1A). Cell
proliferation determined by MTT assay had no significant effect and the survival rate was nearly 100% below
12.5 μg/mL of HY (Figure 1B).

Antiviral Effect of HY
The antiviral effect of HY was analyzed by the relative mRNA expression levels of IBV-N gene (Figure 2A)
and the virus titer (Figure 2B) in CEK cells. From the
Figure 2A, it could be seen that in the 3 experimental
designs, the viral mRNA level significantly decreased
compared with the virus control, and with the increase
of HY concentration, the mRNA level of IBV decreased
in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, at the same
drug concentration, the relative expression levels of the
viral mRNA was the lowest when HY directly treated
the IBV-infected cells, followed by the group of HY pretreatment of IBV prior to cell infection, and followed by
the group of HY pre-treatment of cells prior to IBV infection.
The virus titers at each group was detected and
showed in Figure 2B, with the increase of HY concen-

tration, the titer of IBV decreased gradually. While,
at the same drug concentration, the virus titer was
the lowest when HY directly treated the infected virus
cells, followed by the group of HY pre-treatment virus
prior to infection, and followed by the group of HY pretreatment cells prior to infection.
Meanwhile, the antiviral effect of HY directly
treated the IBV-infected cells at the concentration of
12.5 µg/mL, was similar to RT at the concentration of
10 µg/mL (Figure 2). Therefore, HY directly treated
the IBV-infected cells was selected to conduct in followed experiments.

IFA Analysis Confirmed the Inhibitory Effect
of HY on IBV infection
To further confirm the inhibitory effect of HY on
IBV-infected cells, the viral fluorescent signal was detected by IFA (Figure 3). As can be seen from Figure 3,
IBV-infected CEK cells generated strong fluorescence
signals at 30 h post-infection. In contrast, the fluorescence signals in HY directly treated the IBV-infected
cells decreased obviously in a dose-dependent manner.
This further confirmed the inhibition effect of HY on
IBV-infected cells.

The Effect of HY on IBV-induced Apoptosis
The immunofluorescence results showed that addition of HY to virus-infected cells resulted in fewer
apoptotic cells compared with virus infection control

HYPERICIN INHIBITION OF INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS VIRUS

and apoptosis promoter PAC-1 (20 µM) control group,
and similar to the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
(20 µM) control group (Figure 4A). The number of
apoptotic cells was quantified with flow cytometry. The
results showed that there was ∼2.59-fold decrease in
the percentage of apoptotic cells at 12.5 µg/mL of HY
treatment group compared with virus infection group
(Figures 4B and 4C).

The Effect of HY on Relative mRNA
Expression of Apoptosis-related Genes
The mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related
genes, including Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase
3, and Caspase 8 were determined. As can be seen
from Figure 5, HY treatment significantly reduced the
mRNA levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and
Caspase 8 genes (Figures 5A−D, 5F, and 5G) after IBV
infection at 30 h and 36 h, and significantly increased
the mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 gene after IBV
infection at 24 h, 30 h, and 36 h (Figure 5E). These
data demonstrated that HY inhibited apoptosis in IBVinfected CEK cells by decreasing the expression of proapoptotic genes and increasing anti-apoptotic gene expression. However, no difference could be found in the
above detected parameters in the only HY-treated CEK
cells compared with those in mock cells.

The Effects of HY on ROS Production
We determined the ROS generation in HY directly
treated the IBV-infected cells using DCFH-DA method.
As shown in Figure 6, IBV could significantly induce
the ROS production, while HY could inhibit the ROS
production in IBV-infected CEK cells. And with the
increase of HY concentration, the fluorescence signal of
ROS decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The effect
of inhibiting ROS at 6.25, 12.5 µg/mL of HY treatment
was similar to ROS inhibitors NAC.

DISCUSSION
Our results showed that HY could inhibit IBV infection and inhibit apoptosis and production of ROS in
CEK cells. It has been reported that there were multiple known strains of IBV, IBV strain M41, is typical respiratory virus, which replicates primarily in the
respiratory tract and subsequently spreads and replicates in a range of other tissues (De Wit et al., 2019;
Hodgson et al., 2004). The CEK cells are the most
susceptible cells of strain M41 in vitro (Abdel-Moneim
et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2017). Therefore, we selected
M41 strain for infection of CEK cells to study the antiIBV effect of HY.
In the cytotoxicity assay, MTT assay was performed
to measure cell viability. MTT method is a recognized
and commonly used method to evaluate the metabolic
activity of living cells (Gao et al., 2019; Şueki et al.,

6375

2019). Because HY is low levels of solubility in water
(Bianchini et al., 2019; Montanha et al., 2017), it is insoluble in M199 cell culture medium. In MTT assay,
HY was pro-dissolved in DMSO first, and diluted to a
certain concentration with medium M199. In the process of dilution, the content of DMSO is not more than
1% (Hebling et al., 2015; Şimşek et al., 2015), in order to ensure that DMSO is non-toxic to the cells and
to obtain the maximum non-toxic concentration of HY
accurately. By observing the cell morphology and calculating the cell survival rate, the maximum non-toxic
concentration of HY was 12.50 µg/mL (Figure 1).
A total of 3 different experimental designs: (1) pretreatment of cells prior to infection; (2) direct treatment of virus-infected cells; and (3) pre-treatment of
virus prior to infection were used to analyze the antiviral activity of HY on CEK cells infection by IBV (De La
Torre et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2011). Our results showed
that direct treatment of HY on virus-infected cells
was the best among 3 different experimental designs
(Figure 2). In the direct treatment of HY on virusinfected cells, it may be due to the effect of HY on
infected cells, effectively inhibited the activity of viral
transcriptase, and effectively reduced the replication of
IBV in CEK cells. The pre-treatment of HY on IBV
prior to infection may be related to the photoperiod
and oxygen supply of HY. Under light conditions, HY
could absorb photons, and then stimulate singlet oxygen to play an antiviral role. Because this experiment
was carried out under the condition of no oxygen and
weak light, the direct attack effect of HY on virus particles was not brought into full play, and the killing effect of virus was weakened (Miskovsky, 2002; Xu et al.,
2019). In the pre-treatment of HY on cells prior to infection, HY blockaded on the adsorption of virus in CEK
cells was weak, or did not protect the cells, thus failed
to effectively prevent IBV from entering the host cells
(Pu et al., 2009, 2012). Therefore, in the following experiments, the CEK cells were first infected IBV, and
then incubated HY solution. To further confirm the
inhibitory effect of direct treatment of HY on virusinfected cells, the viral fluorescent signal was detected
by IFA (Figure 3). Our results confirmed the inhibition
effect of direct treatment of HY on virus-infected cells.
While apoptosis usually functions as a host defense mechanism that ensures killing of infected cells
(Elmore, 2007), several viruses, including IBV, have
been shown to induce apoptosis to enable efficient virus
transmission, while avoiding overt inflammatory responses and activation of the immune system (Zhou
et al., 2017). Our results showed that IBV could induce
apoptosis in CEK cells (Figure 4), and increase mRNA
expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3,
and Caspase 8, with the exception of Bcl-2, which significantly decreased after IBV infection (Figure 5), which
was consistent with other reports (Chhabra et al., 2016;
Fung et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2013). It was found
that IBV could increase the mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, and Bax, and decrease the mRNA

6376

expression level of Bcl-2 in IBV-infected HD11 cells
(Han et al., 2017). Another research demonstrated that
JNK served as a pro-apoptotic protein during IBV infection. Interestingly, pro-apoptotic activity of JNK was
not mediated via c-Jun, but involved modulation of the
anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) (Fung
and Liu, 2017). Moreover, our results showed that HY
could inhibit apoptosis induced by IBV on CEK cells
(Figure 4), and reduced mRNA expression levels of
Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, but
increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression level after IBV infection (Figure 5). This is similar with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, in which HY could inhibit
cell apoptosis by affecting the expression of apoptosisrelated genes and inhibit production of ROS (Do and
Kim, 2017).
Antioxidant activity of Hypericum perforatum L. and
its components have been reported (Gioti et al., 2009).
Furthermore, the study showed that HY had an antioxidative effect (Cakir et al., 2003). Therefore, we investigated whether HY ameliorated IBV-induced ROS
generation. Our results revealed that HY could inhibit ROS production in the absence of phototherapy
(Figure 6), which was consistent with other report (Da
Silva et al., 2018).
In summary, the present study was the first time to
show that HY inhibited IBV infection. Furthermore,
anti-IBV effect of HY may be associated with its inhibition of apoptosis and ROS production. HY reduced
the mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes such as Fas,
FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, and upregulated anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl-2) mRNA expression. The data suggest the potential use of HY as antiviral agents against IBV, however, further studies are
required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of HY
on IBV infection.
