Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host. Our previous work with severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs
with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that
additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe
overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat
CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of
PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of
Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show
that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable
to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies
developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results
indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains.

ABSTRACT

IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the pri-

mary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the
results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are
critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and
risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the ﬁndings also offer a novel
means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue
that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus
emergence events in humans.

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the ﬁrst major outbreak of the century, highlighted
the global impact of a newly emerging virus in the context of expanding development,
increased globalization, and poor public health infrastructures (2–4). A decade later, the
emergence and continued outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) further illustrate the ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic
viruses (5). Together, the outbreaks of the early part of this century argue that
continued preparations and vigilance are needed to maintain global public health.
Despite their spontaneous emergence, several research approaches to rapidly respond and even predict outbreak strains already exist. During the MERS-CoV outbreak,
our group and others were able to leverage reagents generated against related group
2C coronaviruses, namely, HKU4- and HKU5-CoV (6, 7). These reagents, created independent of viable virus replication, provided valuable insights and models for testing
serologic responses during the early stages of the MERS-CoV outbreak. Similarly,
reverse genetics systems permitted the exploration of zoonotic coronaviruses (8); using
the known SARS spike/ACE2 receptor interaction, chimeric viruses containing the
backbones of bat CoVs were generated to evaluate the efﬁcacy of both vaccines and
therapeutics (9–12). The inverse approach placed the zoonotic spike proteins in the
context of the epidemic SARS-CoV backbone (13, 14). These studies provided insight
into potential threats circulating in bats as well as the efﬁcacy of current therapeutic
treatments (15). While far from comprehensive, the results indicated that these approaches, reagents, and predictions may prove useful in preparations for future CoV
outbreaks.
In this study, we extend the examination of zoonotic viruses to a novel MERS-like
CoV strain isolated from a Ugandan bat, namely, PDF-2180 CoV (MERS-Uganda). Our
initial attempt to cultivate a chimeric MERS-CoV containing the Ugandan MERS-like
spike produced viral subgenomic transcripts but failed to result in infectious virus after
electroporation (16). However, in the current study, we demonstrate that exogenous
trypsin treatment produced high-titer virus capable of plaque formation and continued
replication. These results are consistent with the recovery of enteric CoVs like porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (17) but have not previously been described as a major barrier
for bat-derived CoVs. The chimeric Ugandan MERS-like spike virus could replicate
efﬁciently in both Vero and Huh7 cells in the context of trypsin-containing media but
failed to produce infection of either continuous or primary human respiratory cell
cultures. Importantly, the MERS-Uganda chimeric virus successfully infected cells of the
human digestive tract, potentially identifying another route for cross-species transmission and emergence. Notably, blockade of human DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV,
had no signiﬁcant impact on replication of the chimeric MERS-Uganda virus, suggesting
the use of an alternative receptor. Similarly, the addition of trypsin also rescued
replication of full-length HKU5-CoV, a related group 2C bat CoV, and showed no
replication defect during DPP4 blockade. Together, the results indicate that proteolytic
activation of the spike protein is a potent constraint to infection for zoonotic CoVs and
expand the correlates for CoV emergence beyond receptor binding alone.
(This article was submitted to an online preprint archive [18].)
RESULTS
Utilizing the MERS-CoV infectious clone (19), we previously attempted to evaluate
the potential of PDF-2180 CoV to emerge from zoonotic populations. Replacing the
wild-type MERS-CoV spike with the PDF-2180 spike produced a virus capable of
generating viral transcripts in vitro but not sustained replication (16). These results
suggested that the signiﬁcant amino acid differences observed within the receptorbinding domain precluded infection of Vero cells. However, amino acid changes were
not conﬁned only to the receptor-binding domain (RBD); highlighting changes between the Uganda spike on the MERS-CoV trimer revealed signiﬁcant differences
throughout the S1 region of spike (Fig. 1A and B). While the S2 remained highly
conserved (Fig. 1C), changes in the C- and N-terminal domains of S1, in addition to the
RBD, may also inﬂuence entry and infection compatibility. Notably, recent reports had

also indicated differential protease cleavage of wild-type MERS-CoV based on cell types,
suggesting that spike processing inﬂuences docking and entry of pseudotyped virus
(20). To explore if spike cleavage impaired infectivity, we evaluated MERS-Uganda virus
replication in the presence of trypsin-containing media. The addition of trypsin to the
chimeric virus resulted in cytopathic effect, fusion of the Vero monolayer, formation of
plaques under a trypsin-containing overlay, and collection of high-titer infectious virus
stock (Fig. 1D). Utilizing the trypsin-treated stock, we subsequently examined the
MERS-Uganda spike by Western blotting, ﬁnding that increasing amounts of trypsin
produced more robust spike expression and cleavage (Fig. 1E). Together, these data
indicate that the PDF-2180 spike can mediate infection of Vero cells in a trypsindependent manner.
The requirement for trypsin complicated our studies due to cell toxicity; to overcome this issue, we utilized both trypsin-adapted Vero cells and a MERS-Uganda
chimera encoding RFP in place of open reading frame 5 (ORF5), similar to a previously
generated MERS-CoV reporter virus (19). Following MERS-Uganda infection, cultures
with trypsin-containing medium showed evidence for replication of viral genomic RNA
(Fig. 2A). Similarly, the nucleocapsid protein was observed only in the presence of
exogenous trypsin following infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera (Fig. 2B). Notably, wild-type MERS-CoV expressing RFP was also augmented in the presence of trypsin
with increased genomic RNA and nucleocapsid protein relative to no trypsin control
(Fig. 2A and B). Examination of RFP signal conﬁrmed these RNA and protein results (Fig.
2C), as RFP was only observed in MERS-Uganda chimeric infection in the presence of

trypsin. Similarly, viral RNA, RFP expression, and N protein expression were more robust
in trypsin-treated cells following MERS-CoV infection. Together, these data indicate that
both the PDF-2180 and MERS-CoV spike have augmented infection of Vero cells in the
presence of trypsin.
MERS-Uganda spike replicates in human cells. Having demonstrated infection
and replication, we next sought to determine the capacity of MERS-Uganda chimeric
virus to grow in human cells. Previously, MERS-CoV had been shown to replicate
efﬁciently in Huh7 cells (21). In the Huh7 liver cell line, infection with MERS-Uganda RFP
chimeric virus resulted in RFP-positive cells and cell fusion (Fig. 3A). In contrast, while
a few RFP-positive cells were observed in the non-trypsin-treated group, neither
expanding RFP expression nor cytopathic effect were seen in the absence of trypsin.
Our observation may have been the result of residual trypsin activity from the undiluted
virus stock, resulting in low-level infection. Exploring further, N protein analysis by
Western blotting indicated that the PDF-2180 spike chimera could produce signiﬁcant
viral proteins in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 3B); only low levels of protein were
observed in the control-treated infection. While replication of the MERS-Uganda chimera was not equivalent to that of wild-type MERS-CoV, the results clearly demonstrate
the capacity of the PDF-2180 spike to mediate infection of human cells in the presence
of trypsin.
We next examined the capacity of the MERS-Uganda spike to infect human respiratory cells, the primary targets of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other common coldcausing human CoVs. Using Calu3 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line, we observed
robust replication of wild-type MERS-CoV based on RFP expression, consistent with
previous studies (19). However, no evidence of infection was noted in MERS-Ugandainfected Calu3 cells in the presence or absence of trypsin. We subsequently explored
infection of primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Grown on an air-liquid
interface, HAE cultures have a propensity to facilitate improved infections of several
human CoVs and may be more permissive for infection with the PDF-2180 spike
chimera (22). To infect, PDF-2180 chimeric virus grown in the presence of trypsin was
inoculated onto the apical surface of the HAE culture; cultures were subsequently

washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 ␮g/ml trypsin at 0, 18, 24,
and 48 hours postinfection for 10 minutes and then removed. Following infection, no
evidence of RFP expression was observed even after trypsin washes of the apical
surface (Fig. 3C). Similarly, RNA expression analysis found no evidence for accumulation
of viral genomic RNA, indicating no evidence for replication in HAE cultures (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, wild-type MERS-CoV efﬁciently infects these HAE cultures, as demonstrated
by both RFP expression and viral genomic RNA accumulation. Together, the Calu3 and
HAE results suggest that the PDF-2180 spike is unable to infect respiratory cells in
humans, even in the presence of exogenous trypsin.
We next evaluated the capacity of the PDF-2180 chimera to infect cells of the
digestive tract. While uncommon in humans, several animal CoVs have been shown to
cause severe disease via the enteric pathway (23, 24). In addition, most bat CoV
sequences, including PDF-2180-CoV, were isolated from bat guano samples, suggesting
an enteric etiology. Importantly, the presence of trypsin and other soluble host proteases in the digestive tract may facilitate infection with the PDF-2180 spike in humans.
To test this question, we infected Caco-2 cells, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, with wild-type MERS-CoV and MERS-Uganda spike chimera in the
presence or absence of trypsin (Fig. 3E). For MERS-CoV, infection of Caco-2 cells resulted
in robust infection and spread with or without trypsin in the media. For the MERSUganda chimera, the addition of trypsin facilitated infection with many RFP-positive
Caco-2 cells; however, infection was not as robust as in the wild-type MERS-CoV
infection. Examination of N protein by Western blotting indicated that the MERSUganda spike could produce infection in Caco-2 cells but conﬁrmed replication at levels
lower than that with wild-type MERS-CoV (Fig. 3F). Together, the results indicate that

human cells, including gut cells, can support infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera
in the presence of trypsin.
MERS-Uganda spike does not use DPP4 for entry. The absence of infection of
human respiratory cells coupled with signiﬁcant changes in the RBD suggested that
MERS-Uganda does not utilize the MERS-CoV receptor human DPP4 for entry (16). To
explore this question, we utilized antibodies to block DPP4 in Vero cells to determine
the effect on MERS-Uganda chimeric virus replication. As expected, the anti-DPP4
antibody successfully ablated replication of wild-type MERS-CoV in both the presence
and the absence of trypsin treatment, as measured by both RFP and N protein
expression (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, the human DPP4-blocking antibody had no
impact on infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera virus in the presence of trypsin,
conﬁrming that the MERS-CoV receptor is not required to mediate infection with the
PDF-2180 spike. Together, these results indicate that while the MERS-Uganda spike
infects human cells, it does not require human DPP4 to mediate infection.

MERS-CoV therapeutics are ineffective against MERS-Uganda spike. Having
established replication capacity in human cells, we next sought to determine if therapeutics developed against the MERS-CoV spike could disrupt infection with the MERSUganda spike chimera. Several monoclonal antibodies have been identiﬁed as possible
therapeutic options for the treatment of MERS-CoV, including LCA60 and G4. We ﬁrst
evaluated LCA60, a potent antibody that binds adjacent to the spike RBD of MERS-CoV
(25). However, the major changes in the RBD region of the MERS-Uganda spike
predicted a lack of efﬁcacy (Fig. 5A). LCA60 potently neutralized wild-type MERS-CoV
grown in both the presence and the absence of trypsin (Fig. 5B). However, consistent
with expectations, the LCA60 antibody had no impact on infection with the MERSUganda chimera, failing to neutralize the bat spike-expressing virus (Fig. 5B). We
subsequently examined a second monoclonal antibody, G4, which had previously
mapped to a conserved portion of the S2 region of the MERS-spike (Fig. 5A) (26). With
the epitope relatively conserved in the MERS-Uganda spike, we tested the efﬁcacy
against the zoonotic spike chimera. However, the results demonstrate no neutralization
of MERS-Uganda spike virus by the S2-targeted antibody (Fig. 5C). Notably, G4 also
failed to neutralize wild-type MERS-CoV grown in the presence of exogenous trypsin
(Fig. 5C). Together, the results indicate that both group 2C CoV spikes could escape
neutralization by the S2-targeted antibody in the presence of exogenous trypsin.
Overall, these experiments suggest that antibodies targeted against MERS-CoV, even to
regions in the highly conserved S2 domain, may not have utility against viruses
expressing the PDF-2180 spike.
Trypsin treatment rescues the replication of zoonotic HKU5-CoV. Based on the
MERS-Uganda chimera virus, we wondered if a similar barrier prevented replication of
other zoonotic CoVs. Previously, our group had generated a full-length infectious clone
for HKU5-CoV, another group 2C coronavirus sequence isolated from bats. Similar to
the MERS-Uganda chimera, the infectious clone of HKU5-CoV produced subgenomic
transcripts but failed to achieve productive infection (6). Revisiting the full-length
recombinant virus, we sought to determine if trypsin treatment could also rescue
HKU5-CoV. Following HKU5-CoV infection, the addition of trypsin to the media resulted

in cytopathic effect and cell fusion. In contrast, cultures lacking trypsin showed no signs
of viral infection. Exploring viral genomic RNA, trypsin in the culture media permitted
robust infection with HKU5-CoV that increased over time and was absent in cells not
treated with trypsin (Fig. 6A). Similarly, trypsin in the media also permitted the
accumulation and proteolytic cleavage of the HKU5 spike protein in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Importantly, the addition of the anti-DPP4 antibody
had no impact on HKU5-CoV infection, suggesting the use of a different receptor than
that used by wild-type MERS-CoV, similar to the ﬁndings with the MERS-Uganda spike
(Fig. 6C). Together, these results demonstrate that protease cleavage is also the primary
barrier to infection of Vero cells with HKU5-CoV. Examining further, we compared the
predicted cleavage at S1/S2 border, S2’, and the endosomal cysteine protease site
across MERS, PDF2180, and HKU5 spikes (Fig. 6D) (26). For the S1/S2 site, MERS, Uganda,
and HKU5 maintain the RXXR cleavage motif, although the different interior amino
acids may alter efﬁciency. For the S2’ sequence, MERS and HKU5 also retain the RXXR
motif; however, the Uganda spike lacks the ﬁrst arginine (SNAR), potentially impacting

cleavage. Finally, all three spikes maintain an aromatic residue at position two in the
endosomal cysteine protease (ECP) site (27). However, the HKU5 spike maintains N at
position 1 which is similar to a MERS mutant previously shown to inactivate cathepsin
L activation (28). Together, the results suggest that potential sequence changes in the
protease cleavage sites may contribute to the trypsin dependency of MERS-Uganda and
HKU5 spike-mediated infections.

DISCUSSION
In the manuscript, we expanded our examination of circulating zoonotic viruses and
identiﬁed protease cleavage as an important barrier to emergence of some group 2C
zoonotic CoVs. The chimeric virus containing the spike protein from PDF-2180 was
capable of replication in Vero cells and human cells (Huh7 and Caco-2) if treated with
exogenous trypsin. However, neither continuous nor primary human airway cultures
were susceptible to infection, in contrast to wild-type MERS-CoV. The MERS-Uganda
chimera also maintained replication despite treatment with antibodies blocking human
DPP4, suggesting use of either an alternative receptor or a different entry mechanism
for infection. Importantly, current therapeutics targeting the MERS spike protein
showed no efﬁcacy against the MERS-Uganda chimera, highlighting a potential public
health vulnerability to this and related group 2C CoVs. Finally, the trypsin-mediated
rescue of a second zoonotic group 2C CoV, HKU5-CoV, validates ﬁndings that suggested that protease cleavage may represent a critical barrier to zoonotic CoV infection
in new hosts (29, 30). Together, the results highlight the importance of spike processing
in CoV infection, expand the correlates associated with emergence beyond receptor
binding alone, and provide a platform strategy to recover previously noncultivatable
zoonotic CoVs.
With the ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic viruses, understanding the
barriers for viral emergence represents a critical area of research. For CoVs, receptor
binding has been believed to be the primary constraint to infection in new host
populations. Following the SARS-CoV outbreak, emergence in humans was attributed
to mutations within the receptor-binding domain that distinguished the epidemic
strain from progenitor viruses harbored in bats and civets (31). Yet, work by our group
and others has indicated that zoonotic SARS-like viruses circulating in Southeast Asian
bats are capable of infecting human cells by binding to the known human ACE2
receptor without adaptation (13, 14, 32). Similarly, pseudotyped virus studies have
identiﬁed zoonotic strains HKU4-CoV and NL140422-CoV as capable of binding to
human DPP4 without mutations to the spike (30, 33). In this study, we demonstrate that
both PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV spikes are capable of binding to and infecting human
cells if primed by trypsin cleavage. Together, the results argue that several circulating
zoonotic CoV strains have the capacity to bind to human cells without adaption and
that receptor binding may not be the only barrier to CoV emergence.
Data from this study implicate the processing of the spike protein as a critical factor
for CoV infection. In the absence of trypsin, the MERS-Uganda and HKU5-CoV spikes
were unable to mediate infection and initially suggested a lack of receptor compatibility (6, 16). However, exogenous trypsin treatment produced robust infection, indicating that despite binding to human cells, CoVs cannot overcome incomplete spike
processing. As such, evaluating zoonotic virus populations for emergence threats must
also consider the capacity for CoV spike activation in addition to receptor binding.
While exogenous processing of the spike has been well described as necessary for
enteric CoVs (17), spike processing has not been considered a primary barrier for bat
CoVs despite their enteric origins. In this new paradigm for bat CoVs, the combination
of receptor binding and proteolytic activation by endogenous proteases permits
zoonotic CoV infection, as with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Fig. 7). The absence of
receptor binding (Fig. 7A) or compatible host protease activity (Fig. 7B) restricts
infection with certain zoonotic strains like PDF-2180 or HKU5-CoV. These barriers can be
overcome with the addition of exogenous proteases, disrupting the need for host
proteases and permitting receptor-dependent or receptor-independent entry (Fig. 7C).

FIG 7 Barriers to zoonotic coronavirus emergence. Both receptor binding and protease activitation are
key correlates that govern zoonotic coronavirus emergence. (A) A lack of receptor binding with zoonotic
CoVs precludes the infection of new host cells. (B) Despite receptor binding, the absence of compatible
host proteases for spike cleavage restricts infection in new hosts. (C) The addition of exogenous protease
overcomes the host protease barriers and may or may not require receptor binding.

Overall, the new paradigm argues that both receptor binding and protease activation
barriers must be overcome for successful zoonotic CoV infection of a new host.
The requirement for exogenous trypsin treatment is not unique to MERS-Uganda or
HKU5-CoV. Inﬂuenza strains are well known to require trypsin treatment to facilitate
their release in cell culture (34). In addition, highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza strains
have been linked to mutations that improve cleavage by ubiquitous host protease,
augmenting their tissue tropism and virulence (35). Similarly, a wealth of enteric viruses,
including polio, cowpox, and rotaviruses, depend on trypsin to prime, modulate, and/or
expand infection (36, 37). Even within the CoV family, enteric viruses, including porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine delta CoV, and swine acute diarrhea syndrome
(SADS) CoV require trypsin for replication in vitro (38–40). Together, these prior studies
illustrate the importance of protease activation in virus infections. However, the protease barrier to PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV spike-mediated infection may also reﬂect on
the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. While initial studies argued that receptor
binding was the primary barrier, the existence of zoonotic strains capable of efﬁciently
using the same human entry receptors contradicts that suggestion (13, 14). It is possible
that emergence of epidemic CoV strains also requires modifying protease cleavage in
either humans or an intermediate host, such as camels or civets, in addition to
increased receptor-binding afﬁnity. Consistent with this idea, reports have detailed
differential infection with MERS-CoV based on host protease expression (20). Similarly,
mouse adaptation of MERS-CoV resulted in spike modiﬁcations that alter protease
activation and entry in vivo (41). Coupled with the augmented replication and protein
production of wild-type MERS-CoV in the presence of trypsin, the results suggest that
the proteolytic cleavage epidemic MER-CoV could still be enhanced, potentially by
augmenting the cell surface entry mechanism, as previously described for SARS-CoV
(42). While group 2B bat CoV strains (WIV1-CoV, WIV16-CoV, and SHC014-CoV) do not
require trypsin for infection (9, 13, 14, 43), differences in protease activation may
contribute to infection changes relative to the epidemic SARS-CoV. In this context, our
ﬁndings expand the importance of protease cleavage as a criterion to consider for
zoonotic virus emergence in a new host population.
In evaluating the threat to humans posed by PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV, the results
demonstrate a pathway to emergence. Neither CoV spike uses human DPP4 for entry,
and the PDF-2180 chimera failed to replicate in human respiratory models, even in the
presence of trypsin. As many different proteases can promote CoV entry, future studies

must determine if other protease treatments or other components can promote virus
replication in HAE cultures (29, 44, 45). However, replication in Huh7 and Caco-2 cells
indicates human infection compatibility and may portend differential tropism, possibly
in the alimentary or biliary tracts, as has been described for several mammalian CoVs
(38–40). MERS-Uganda or HKU5-CoV could utilize this same trypsin-rich environment in
the gut to emerge as an enteric pathogen in humans, although its pathology and
virulence would be hard to predict. Evidence from both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
outbreaks suggests the involvement of enteric pathways during infection (46, 47).
Replication in the gut might select for mutations that expand spike processing/tropism
and allow replication in other tissues, including the lung, and lead to virulent disease
in the new host population, as seen with porcine respiratory coronavirus (48). In
examining the threat posed by PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV, we must consider the
emergence of these CoVs in tissues other than the lung and that they harbor distinct
pathologies compared with epidemic SARS and MERS-CoV.
The receptor dynamics of MERS-Uganda and HKU5-CoV also remain unclear in the
context of this study. In the presence of trypsin, neither spike protein requires the
MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 for entry, which is consistent with the differences between
the receptor-binding domains of the bat and epidemic strains. Therefore, it was not
surprising that antibodies that target the RBD of the MERS-CoV spike were ineffective
in blocking infection of the PDF-2180 chimera. However, the S2-targeted antibody G4
also had no efﬁcacy against MERS-Uganda, despite a relatively conserved binding
epitope. This result is possibly explained by differing amino acid sequences between
MERS-CoV and PDF-2180 at the G4 epitope, speciﬁcally residue 1175, which is associated with G4 escape mutants in MERS-CoV (49). Alternatively, the G4 antibody also
failed to neutralize wild-type MERS-CoV grown in the presence of trypsin, indicating
that entry is still possible, despite treatment with antibody binding the S2 domain.
These results suggest that trypsin treatment may permit a conformational change
either masking the G4 epitope or facilitating fusion/entry prior to antibody binding.
Conversely, the presence of trypsin may prime a receptor-independent entry for the
MERS-Uganda chimera, similar to the JHVM strain of MHV (50). Yet, this result would
contrast with that of PEDV, which requires receptor binding prior to trypsin activation
to facilitate infection (39). Importantly, the lack of infection in respiratory cells suggests
that some receptor or attachment factor is necessary to mediate entry with the
PDF-2180 spike. Recent work with MERS-CoV binding sialic acid supports this idea (51)
and indicates that the PDF-2180 spike may not have a similar binding motif. Overall,
further experimental studies are required to fully understand the receptor dynamics of
the PDF-2180 spike.
While providing a new strategy to recover zoonotic CoVs, the manuscript highlights
proteolytic cleavage of the spike as a major barrier to group 2C zoonotic CoV infection.
For both MERS-Uganda and HKU5-CoV, the addition of exogenous trypsin rescues
infection, indicating that spike cleavage, not receptor binding, limits these strains in
new hosts and tissues. The adaptation of the protease cleavage sites or infection of
tissues with robust host protease expression could permit these two zoonotic CoV
strains to emerge and may pose a threat to public health due to the absence of
effective spike-based therapeutics. In considering cross-species transmission, our results using reconstructed bat group 2C CoVs conﬁrm spike processing as a correlate
associated with emergence. Adding spike processing to receptor binding as primary
barriers offers a new framework to evaluate the threat of emergence for zoonotic CoV
strains.

lungs procured under University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board-approved
protocols. Wild-type MERS-CoV, chimeric MERS-Uganda, and HKU5-CoV were cultured on Vero cells in
Opti-MEM (Gibco) supplemented with anti/anti. For indicated experiments, trypsin (Gibco) was added at
0.5 ␮g/ml unless otherwise indicated.
Generation of wild-type MERS-CoV, MERS-Uganda, and HKU5-CoV viruses utilized reverse genetics
and have been previously described (6, 16, 19). For MERS-Uganda chimera expressing RFP, we utilized the
MERS-CoV backbone, replacing ORF5 with RFP as previously described (19). Synthetic constructions of
chimeric mutant and full-length MERS-Uganda and HKU5-CoV were approved by the University of North
Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Replication in Vero, Calu-3 2B4, Caco-2, Huh7, and HAE cells was performed as previously described
(12, 52–54). Brieﬂy, cells were washed with PBS and inoculated with virus or mock diluted in Opti-MEM
for 60 minutes at 37°C. Following inoculation, cells were washed three times, and fresh medium with or
without trypsin was added to signify time zero. Three or more biological replicates were harvested at
each described time point. For HAE cultures, apical surfaces were washed with PBS containing 5 ␮g/ml
trypsin at 0, 8, 18, 24, and 48 hours postinfection. Sample collections were not conducted in a blind
manner nor were samples randomized. Microscopy photos were captured via a Keyence BZ-X700
microscope.
For antibody neutralization assays, MERS-CoV and MERS-Uganda stocks were grown in Opti-MEM
both with and without trypsin. All stocks were quantiﬁed via plaque assay by overlaying cells with 0.8%
agarose in Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.5 ␮g/ml trypsin and anti/anti. MERS-Uganda stocks grown
without trypsin had low titers but were sufﬁcient for neutralization assays.
For anti-DPP4 blocking experiments, Vero cells were preincubated with serum-free Opti-MEM
containing 5 ␮g/ml anti-human DPP4 antibody (R&D systems, MN) for 1 hour. Medium was removed, and
cells were infected for 1 hour with virus or mock inoculum at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. The
inoculum was removed, cells were washed three times with PBS, and medium was replaced.
RNA isolation and quantiﬁcation. RNA was isolated via TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA) and
Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MERS-CoV
and MERS-Uganda genomic RNA (gRNA) was quantiﬁed via TaqMan fast virus 1-step master mix (Applied
Biosystems, CA) using previously reported primers and probes targeting ORF1ab (54) and normalized to
host 18S rRNA (Applied Biosystems). HKU5-CoV RNA was ﬁrst reverse transcribed using SuperScript III
(Invitrogen) and was then assayed using SsoFast EvaGreen supermix (Bio-Rad, CA) and scaled to host
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript levels. HKU5 gRNA was ampliﬁed with
the following primers: forward, 5=-CTCTCTCTCGTTCTCTTGCAGAAC-3=; and reverse, 5=-GTTGAGCTCTGCT
CTATACTTGCC-3=. GAPDH RNA was ampliﬁed with the following primers: forward, 5=-AGCCACATCGCT
GAGACA-3=; and reverse, 5=-GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC-3=. Fold change was calculated using the
threshold cycle (ΔΔCT) method and was scaled to RNA present at 0 hours postinfection.
Generation of VRP, polyclonal mouse antisera, and Western blot analysis. Virus replicon particles
(VRPs) expressing the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid, MERS-Uganda spike, or HKU5-5 CoV spike were constructed using a non-select agent biosafety level 2 (BSL2) Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)
strain 3546 replicon system, as previously described (55). Brieﬂy, RNA containing the nonstructural genes
of VEEV and either MERS-CoV nucleocapsid or HKU5-5 CoV spike was packaged using helper RNAs
encoding VEEV structural proteins as described previously (56). Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were
primed and boosted with VRPs to generate mouse antisera toward either MERS-CoV nucleocapsid or
HKU5-5 CoV spike. Following vaccination, mouse polyclonal sera were collected as described previously
(57). For Western blotting, lysates from infected cells were prepared as described before in detail (58),
and these blots were probed using the indicated mouse polyclonal sera. MERS-CoV N sera was able to
detect to HKU5-CoV N protein via Western blot as previously described (7).
Virus neutralization assays. Plaque reduction neutralization titer assays were performed with
previously characterized antibodies against MERS-CoV, as previously described (25, 49). Brieﬂy, antibodies were serially diluted 6- to 8-fold and incubated with 80 PFU of the indicated viruses for 1 h at 37°C.
The virus and antibodies were then added to a 6-well plate of conﬂuent Vero cells in triplicate. After a
1 hour incubation at 37°C, cells were overlaid with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in Opti-MEM supplemented with
0.5 ␮g/ml trypsin and anti/anti. Plates were incubated for 2 or 3 days at 37°C for MERS-CoV or MERSUganda, respectively, and were then stained with neutral red for 3 h, and plaques were counted. The
percentage of plaque reduction was calculated as (1 – [number of plaques with antibody/number of
plaques without antibody]) ⫻ 100.
Biosafety and biosecurity. Reported studies were initiated after the University of North Carolina
Institutional Biosafety Committee approved the experimental protocols. All work for these studies was
performed with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs) and safety conditions for MERS-CoV and
other related CoVs. Our institutional CoV BSL3 facilities have been designed to conform to the safety
requirements recommended by Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Laboratory safety plans have been
submitted, and the facility has been approved for use by the UNC Department of Environmental Health
and Safety (EHS) and the CDC.
