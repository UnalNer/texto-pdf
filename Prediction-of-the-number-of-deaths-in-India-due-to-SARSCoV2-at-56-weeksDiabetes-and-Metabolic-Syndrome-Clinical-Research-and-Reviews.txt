Introduction: and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the
SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought
havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was
aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in
India.
Material and methods: Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated signiﬁcantly with any of the chosen
inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression
model.
Results: A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31
e2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass
the test of statistical signiﬁcance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input
the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of
our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models.
Conclusion: According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is
211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.

1. Introduction
The pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) caused
by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2) has created a havoc on the human civilization. Since, its
appearance in the city of Wuhan (Hebei district) in China, it has
been a relentless march of new cases and deaths [1]. What makes
it more scary is the novel strain of the virus and the unknowns
associated with it [2]. The present strategy has been to prevent
its spread by social isolation and a scientiﬁc overdrive to
manufacture newer rapid diagnostic kits as well as medications
[3e5]. Coronavirus belongs to a family of RNA viruses within the

virus family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [6]. Coronaviruses
are divided into three groups depending on the antigenic spikes
produced by different protein structures of the virus (spike,
membrane & nucleocapsid) [7]. The SARS coronavirus falls under
group 2.
The ability of this family of viruses to readily undergo genetic
recombination not only within same group, but also between
group, makes them readily susceptible to natural selection and
changing its nature of virulence [8]. The most striking feature
however, is its ability to freely cross from one species to another.
HCoV 229 E belongs to the group 1 of the coronaviruses family
thought to be responsible for the epidemic of common cold [7].
Transmission from bats to humans is thought to be the initial
transmission process for HCoV 229 E, which had happened
within the last two centuries. However, the two dramatic events-

Jupyter notebook and analysed with the Python 3.8.2 software. As a
re-validation process and for simplicity of understanding the data
was also analysed using excel with XL-STAT statistical software.

SARS-CoV (originated from bats and got transmitted from civet
cats) & MERS-CoV (originated from bats and got transmitted
from camels) in 2003 and 2012 respectively brough our focus
back on the coronavirus family [8,9]. The present coronavirus
pandemic is the result of changes in the receptor binding domain
of the spike protein component via natural selection (?in human
host/?in animal vector) resulting in its increased afﬁnity for the
ACE2 receptor site [10]. ]At present we have more than 450000
individuals affected with Cov-2 resulting in more than 12000
deaths worldwide [11]. In India, as the present day statistics
holds, we have around 718 conﬁrmed cases with 13 deaths [12].
Several countries including India have gone into a state of lockdown in order to prevent spread of this deadly virus. With new
rapid-diagnostic kits coming in and trials with potentially helpful
drugs underway, we need a better understanding of the disease
process and what it holds for the near future. With all the CoV-2
related data available through reliable sources, we choose to
assimilate the available data on total infection rates, total deaths,
case fatality rates (CFR), recovery numbers from across the globe
and create a predictive analysis on what we can expect in India in
the coming weeks.
The aim was to identify the top 15 countries i.e. those most
heavily affected and hence could contribute to a substantial quantity of robust data, and compute a predictive model for India. We
thought this was of paramount importance, since it would help
understanding as well as planning for the future course of action.
India has entered week 4. This analysis was aimed at tracing a
trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of
the COVID-19 in India.

Inputs: Total number of infected cases, active cases, recovery
numbers,.
Outputs: Total deaths and case fatality rates (CFR)
In order to get a good predictive value data was analysed for the
top 15 infected countries with India the 16th country.
2.1. Pre-analysis phase
There was one missing data (NA) in the dataset, which was the
recovery numbers from the US. In view of the heterogeneity of data
and signiﬁcant outliers data imputation with mean was ruled out.
As a recovery strategy a correlation analysis was conducted
(leaving out the US data) using python and a strong r ¼ 0.99
(P < 0.001) was found between total number of infected cases and
recovery. Utilising this robust association and the formula generated from linear regression (Y [Recovery cases | USA] ¼ b0 þ b1*
[Total cases | USA], with b0 ¼ -781.05 and b1 ¼ 0.869), the missing
value (1117) was derived. The analysis was conducted thereafter
(Table 1).
3. Results
Analysis for week 5 death number prediction:
 Step1: A correlation analysis was performed to ascertain the
presence of and thereafter the strength of association between
the output (week 5 death count) and the inputs from week 4.
There was a strong correlation between week 5 deaths and all
the input variables (Table 2).

2. Materials and methods
Global data was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation
report and the Indian data was updated from the website
covid19india.org. Data was collected in a CSV ﬁle and uploaded in

 Step 2: A multivariate regression analysis ascertained the most
important input parameters which would be used to build the
model for the 5th week death prediction in India. The model
came out to have a very strong predictive capacity (r ¼ 0.99,
R2 ¼ 0.98, adjusted R2 ¼ 0.97). However, the P-value was signiﬁcant only for the 4th week death input parameter (Table 3).

 Step 3: A simple regression analysis was subsequently done to
predict the death counts from the strongest input variable
(Table 4). The model was robust with r ¼ 0.87, R2 ¼ 0.77 &
adjusted R2 ¼ 0.75, P < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.31e2.60. Based on the
upper limit(maximum) & the lower limit (minimum) of the
conﬁdence intervals, the minimum, maximum and average
death counts for week 5 was computed-211 (Table 4). Hence the
week 5 death counts for India was predicted based on the
available data from the top 15 infected countries.

3.1. Death number prediction for week 6
 Step 1: Correlation study was conducted to ascertain the relationship between the output (week 6 death counts) and the
input variables from week 4. A good correlation was observed
with all the input variables.

measures being taken? What can we expect, if we allow the present
trend to continue and mimic the exponential growth experienced
by China and our western counterparts? Our analysis predicts a
jump from approximately 10 deaths at week 4e211 at week 5 and
then 467 by week 6.
We speculate the need for urgent interventions (which are
being taken as of now), to prevent this drastic and sharp rise in
death rates which indirectly also indicates an increase in infection
rate.
4.2. Limitations of this analysis

 Step 2: Multiple regression analysis was done to ascertain the
strength of association between the input variables and the
output, including ruling out issues related to multi-collinearity.
Once again the model created was very robust with r ¼ 0.95,
R2 ¼ 0.91 & adjusted R2 ¼ 0.86 (Table 5). However, the P-value
for signiﬁcance was not evident for any of the input variables.
 Step 3: Auto-Regression technique- The 5th week death count
data was incorporated as the input variable, in view of the fact
that this end-point was signiﬁcantly associated with the week 4
death count. A separate correlation analysis was performed
between week 5 and week 6 death counts and a very robust
association (r ¼ 0.97) was found justifying its inclusion as the
input variable.
 Step 4: Using week 5 death count as input a simple linear
regression was performed to create a model predicting the week
6 outcomes. The model was robust (r ¼ 0.96, R2 ¼ 0.94, adjusted
R2 ¼ 0.94) and statistically signiﬁcant (P-value <0.001, 95% CI:
1.13e1.54).
 Step 5: From the regression model formula the minimum,
maximum, and average death count was estimated (Table 6).
The average predicted death count for India was estimated to be
467.
4. Discussion
India is in the 4th week of the coronavirus pandemic. What lies
ahead for India is the crucial stage, week 5e6 where effective
preventive measures can prevent a potential catastrophe, which
countries like China, Italy and the United States of America are
experiencing, with an exponential growth of both infection as well
as deaths. Exponential progression in the number of infected cases
have occurred from the 4th week onwards, in the above mentioned
countries [11].
At the point of going to the press, there are approximately
4,89,853 conﬁrmed cases of coronavirus infection worldwide
including 22,152 deaths [11]. Luckily, at 4th week, India has escaped
the brunt of the disease with ﬁgures hovering around 693
conﬁrmed infections and 13 deaths. It is the next couple of weeks
which holds the key to the direction the virus takes or doesn’t take
if we take adequate preventive steps.
India has already taken strong measures including complete
lockdown of both its internal and external borders as well as social
isolation.
4.1. How does this analysis help?
Assessing the trends of the top 15 most infected countries a
predictive model was created for India assuming that the same
trend would follow. In other words can we justify the drastic

The main limitation of this analysis was that it takes most input
data into consideration without taking into account the logistic
actions being taken or not taken during the process. However, the
end of weeks results are highly indicative of both the virus-related
natural trajectory as well as the local government’s reactions.
Secondly, limiting our analysis to the top 15 most infected
countries could lead to an over-estimation of the outcomes. However, faced with a catastrophe of such magnitude, it is worth overestimating rather than under-estimating.
4.3. Strength of the study
In spite of all the limitations the biggest strength of this study
was very high adjusted R2 found in all the predictive models. In
addition there was cross-validation with two different software
practically ruling out any error creeping in from one mode of
analysis.
5. Conclusion
According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state;
projected death rate (n) is 211 and 467 at the end of the 5th and 6th
week from now, respectively. Keeping these projected mortality
data in mind, current measured for containment of COVID-19 must
be strengthened or supplemented.
