Evaluating the potential impact of targeted
vaccination strategies against severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks in the
healthcare setting
Fatima Abdirizak*, Rayleen Lewis and Gerardo Chowell

Abstract
Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are two
coronaviruses with demonstrated potential to generate significant nosocomial outbreaks. In particular, MERS continues
to pose a significant threat in the Middle East since 2012. Currently, no licensed vaccine or drug treatment is available
to treat patients infected with either coronavirus. However, there are some MERS vaccines in the preclinical stage
of development. We sought to evaluate the potential impact of targeted vaccination strategies for mitigating SARS and
MERS outbreaks in healthcare settings using simple mathematical models and detailed historic transmission trees
describing the progression of past nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and MERS.
Results: Our findings suggest that vaccination strategies targeting patients and healthcare workers, which have
been disproportionately affected during past outbreaks, and assuming two vaccination coverage levels at 50 and
75% have the potential to avert nearly 50% or more of MERS or SARS cases.
Conclusion: Our modeling results informed by historic outbreak data for SARS and MERS suggest that vaccination
strategies targeting patients could be an effective measure to mitigate and prevent outbreaks in the healthcare setting.

Background
The 2003 outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome
(SARS) were reported in 26 countries with a total of 8098
cases after 6 months [1, 2]. Although many countries
reported cases of SARS, the disease was often limited to a
few travel-related cases without any further subsequent
spread [3]. However, five areas- Canada, China, Hong
Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam- experienced substantial
SARS outbreaks [3]. Sporadic importation of MERS, a related coronavirus, outside of the Middle East has primarily

been due to returning travelers from the Middle East [4, 5].
Sustained MERS transmission outside of the Middle East
was atypical until the South Korea outbreak, which became
the largest MERS outbreak outside of the Middle East [5,
6]. The index patient in the South Korea outbreak developed MERS associated symptoms after returning from the
Middle East [7]. After being discharged from the initial
clinic he visited, he subsequently visited an emergency
department in another hospital on the same day [7]. In the
span of ten days, the index patient was seen in three hospitals [8]. By the end of the South Korea outbreak, there were
186 MERS cases involving 17 hospitals generated from a

single transmission chain stemming from the index
patient [8, 9].
Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has reported approximately
82% of MERS-CoV cases worldwide [5, 10]. The first
MERS-CoV case was first identified in Saudi Arabia and
has generated recurrent nosocomial outbreaks in the
Middle East and one substantial outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015 [5]. Outbreaks in healthcare settings
have been associated with overcrowding conditions,
movement of undetected cases through the facility, and
insufficient implementation of infection prevention and
control measures [4, 5]. Additionally, the practice of
seeking care at multiple health facilities, commonly referred to as “ hospital shopping”, is suspected to have
contributed to the spread of MERS across varies hospitals in South Korea [7, 8]. The transmission dynamics of
MERS-CoV outbreaks resemble those of the 2003-2014
SARS-CoV-a outbreaks in several areas of the world [11].
The modes of transmission and risk factors for MERS infection remain unclear. However, exposure to infectious
camel or camel products appears to play an important role
in triggering outbreaks [5, 12]. Thus, given the recurrent
nature of MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and the
risk posed to other countries, it is important to understand the role of specific control interventions particularly
in the healthcare setting [13–17].
Preventing and limiting the size of future outbreaks,
especially of MERS-CoV, remains a priority for public
health, and use of a vaccine in high-risk populations could
be key to reduce associated mortality. Although SARS
outbreaks have not been reported for 13 years, modeling
SARS transmission and control in the healthcare setting
could help devise control strategies for controlling MERS
outbreaks, which are still occurring to date [5, 18]. SARS
and MERS share some commonalities. Both diseases are
notably seen to be amplified in healthcare settings and
show to have some degree of transmission heterogeneity
where superspreaders are a hallmark [11]. Currently, there
are no reliable antiviral drugs or vaccines available for
either coronaviruses, thus rapid diagnosis has been fundamental in managing outbreaks [19]. However, the lack of
an appropriate animal model that mimics that natural
history of the disease has slowed down the development
of effective pharmaceutical interventions against MERSCoV [20].
Once a MERS-CoV vaccine becomes available, it will
be important to implement effective vaccination strategies, such as targeting those groups that generate the
most MERS and SARS cases [21]. In this paper, we aim
to model the potential impact of targeted vaccination
strategies against hospital-based MERS and SARS transmission by using stochastic simulations and detailed
transmission trees that describe the course of past MERS
and SARS outbreaks in healthcare settings.

Methods
Our methodology to assess the impact of targeted vaccination strategies builds on prior modeling methods described
in ref. [21]. In our study, we modeled the potential impact
of targeted vaccination strategies on nosocomial outbreaks
of MERS and SARS using transmission trees describing the
temporal progression of past coronavirus outbreaks (Fig. 1).
Our work expands the work in ref. [21] by providing simulation algorithms for generating multiple stochastic realizations to assess the effect of vaccination strategies using
Monte Carlo simulation methods (Additional file 1).
Data source

Transmission trees provide detailed information on the epidemiological links between cases, help identify superspreaders, and highlight the duration of an outbreak in
terms of disease generations. The transmission trees used
in our analyses have been previously published in ref. [11].
The South Korea MERS outbreak took place in the summer of 2015 from May to July [22–24]. The transmission
tree associated with this outbreak consists of 164 cases with
64% of those cases being patients (Fig. 1a) [22–24]. The
SARS outbreaks in Singapore and Toronto occurred relatively around the same time in 2003 and unlike the MERS
outbreak, most cases were among Healthcare workers
(HCWs) and family/visitors [25, 26]. The transmission trees
developed for these SARS outbreaks consist of 186 and 90
cases each for Singapore and Toronto (Fig. 1b-c) [25, 26].
Super-spreading events involve a single case, exposure to
which results in a large number of secondary cases. Superspreading events appeared to occur in the SARS and MERS
outbreaks, with the number of cases resulting from each
ranging from 8 to as many as 79 cases.
Here we assess vaccination strategies designed according to the distribution of cases among specific exposure
categories in the healthcare setting: patients, healthcare
workers, family or visitor, and other clinical staff (Table 1
& Fig. 2). In ref. [11], a comparative analysis on SARS
and MERS outbreaks in healthcare settings revealed that
MERS mostly affected patients whereas SARS greatly
affected healthcare workers. Based on these findings,
vaccination strategies were formulated by considering
target population and vaccine coverage. For simplicity,
here we assume that vaccine efficacy for each vaccination strategy is assumed to be 100%. Without loss of
generality, vaccination coverage can also be interpreted
as an “effective vaccination coverage” resulting from the
product of vaccination coverage and vaccine efficacy.
Vaccine strategies
Vaccination strategy 1 (healthcare workers)

In this strategy, vaccination targets healthcare workers
and assumes that vaccination covers 75% of healthcare
workers all of whom are selected at random.

category: patients, family/visitor, healthcare worker, and non-clinical staff

Vaccination strategy 2 (healthcare workers)

Vaccination targets healthcare workers, but the target
vaccination coverage is lowered to 50%.
Vaccination strategy 3 (patients)

Patients have been seen to play a significant role in MERS
transmission, which is most evident by inspecting the
South Korea MERS transmission tree (Fig. 1). Thus, this
strategy involves randomly vaccinating 75% of patients in
the hospital.
Vaccination strategy 4 (patients)

In the case of MERS especially, individuals infected with
MERS were older and likely to present with pre-existing

conditions [11, 12, 14, 17, 22]. Since some patients may
not be eligible to receive the vaccine, we also considered
a lower vaccination coverage of 50%.
Our algorithm employed to simulate the effects of
vaccination strategies consists of the following four
steps: (see Fig. 3).
Step 1: Individual Selection for Vaccination
Starting from a single transmission tree, the target
individuals to be vaccinated are selected at random.
Step 2: Individual Vaccination
Once the individuals to be vaccinated are selected,
those cases are automatically averted and removed from
the outbreak (i.e., vaccine efficacy is 100%).

After averting the cases that have been vaccinated, all
subsequent secondary individuals stemming from vaccinated cases are therefore considered averted.
Step 4: Repeat
In this study, we carried out 100 stochastic realizations
of this vaccination process per transmission tree for each
vaccination strategy. The algorithm was coded in R and
is provided in the Additional file 1.

Analysis

After the vaccination strategy was completed, we assumed
that each person exposed to a case became infected. The
proportion of cases averted for each simulation was calculated by dividing the number of cases averted by the total
number of cases comprising the outbreak. The mean
proportion of cases averted and corresponding 95% confidence interval using a z-distribution were calculated from

Fig. 3 A vaccination strategy was modeled according to the following algorithm

100 simulations. To create the graphs, 100 simulations of
the vaccination strategy were run for a given vaccination
coverage. For each simulation, the proportion of cases
averted was calculated. The mean proportion of cases
averted from the 100 simulations was recorded. This
process was repeated for each vaccination strategy.

Results
Strategy 1: vaccinating 75% of HCWs

Vaccinating 75% of HCWs appears to be a more effective strategy for SARS rather than for MERS. Only 10%
(CI 4–16%) of cases were averted in the MERS outbreak.
For Toronto, 27% (CI 18–36%) of the 90 cases were
averted. Singapore would have benefitted the most from
strategy 1, with a total of 36% (CI 26–45%) of cases
averted (Table 2 & Fig. 4).
Strategy 2: vaccinating 50% of HCWs

Reduction in coverage among HCWs inevitably averted
fewer cases than strategy 1. In the South Korea transmission tree, reducing the vaccination coverage resulted in
about a 50% decrease in the number of cases averted
compared to strategy 1. Similar results were seen in the
Singapore outbreak, only 22% (CI 14–30%) of cases were

averted. In the Toronto outbreak, 18% (CI 10–25%) of
cases were averted, which is only a 9% decline from the
percent of averted cases in strategy 1 (Table 2 & Fig. 4).
Strategy 3: vaccinating 75% of patients

Compared to vaccinating HCW, vaccinating 75% of
patients averted more than 50% of cases in all of the
outbreaks. For South Korea, 76% (CI 67–84%) of the
cases were averted. Interestingly, vaccinating patients
was also the most effective strategy in both SARS outbreaks. With this strategy, 57% (CI 47–67%) and 67%
(CI 57–76%) of cases are averted respectively for South
Korea, Singapore, and Toronto (Table 2 & Fig. 4).
Strategy 4: vaccinating 50% of patients

Although vaccination coverage was reduced among patients, the percent of averted cases were either very close
to 50% or much higher. Reducing vaccination coverage
among patients resulted in a slight decline of 15, 6, and
18% for South Korea, Singapore, and Toronto in the
total number of cases averted. Consequently, 61% of
cases were averted for South Korea, 57 and 48% of cases
were prevented for Singapore and Toronto (Table 2 &
Fig. 4).

Discussion
Our study provides the first analysis of coronavirus vaccine deployment strategies in the healthcare settings
using simulations studies. Our modeling results indicate
that for both viruses vaccinating at least 75% of patients
yields a higher number of averted cases than any other
vaccination strategy considered in our study. Although
HCWs appear to be most affected by SARS, patients
tend to infect the most people; therefore, vaccinating
patients would achieve the greatest reduction in the
number of HCWs infected. Additionally, for all the outbreaks the superspreaders were mostly patients and very
few were family/visitors.
Furthermore, superspreaders are the hallmark of SARS
and MERS transmission, which have been evident in the
observed outbreaks (Fig. 1). For example, in South
Korea, the index patient infected thirty individuals and
in addition to two other patients collectively infected
75% of the cases involved in the outbreak [28]. Similarly,
several super-spreading events occurred during the
SARS epidemic. The index case in the Hong Kong
outbreak was responsible for at least 125 cases and the
same was observed at the Amoy Gardens housing complex and on the Air China flight [28]. Above all, early
detection and compliance to infection control measures
are fundamental in reducing the transmission of SARS
but more importantly MERS, which still remains an
issue [11, 28]. However, in the absence of such interventions, our study supports the deployment of vaccines
targeting patients to lessen the risk of super-spreading
events and ultimately avert the most cases.
Although patients play a prominent role in transmission in both SARS and MERS outbreaks, simply vaccinating all patients that enter a healthcare facility may be
problematic and infeasible in some high-risk areas. Planning to vaccinate all patients is similar to implementing
a national vaccination campaign. Additionally, patients
have various lengths of hospital stay depending on the
severity of their condition. A patient visiting an emergency room for a few hours may not have the same risk
for MERS as a patient staying in the hospital for days or
even months. It typically takes the body a few weeks to
produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination [29] so vaccinating patients during an outbreak
may not be effective considering that immunity would
not be built in time. We propose vaccinating patients
with chronic diseases that require them to have multiple
encounters with healthcare facilities such as those who
are diabetic, have a respiratory illness, hypertension, or
heart disease. For example, In Saudi Arabia with a population of roughly 30 million people, ~ 4.6 million annual
visits are made to chronic disease clinics [30]. In the
Al-Hasa outbreak, 52% of patients had end-stage renal
disease, 74% had diabetes mellitus, 39% had cardiac

Page 7 of 8

disease, and 43% had lung disease [27]. In the Jeddah
outbreak, 35% of patients had secondary exposure to
MERS in the renal dialysis outpatient facility [14]. This
evidence suggests a significant benefit in vaccinating
patients with chronic diseases that put them at risk for
MERS infection to ultimately reduce MERS transmission
in healthcare settings.
There are limitations to this study. First, we only had access to a limited number of transmission trees for past
outbreaks of MERS and SARS that include patients and
healthcare workers. Having multiple transmission trees
for MERS that capture the interaction between various exposure categories would provide additional evidence in
determining the most effective vaccination strategy. Given
the similarities between SARS and MERS transmission dynamics such as the superspreader events, we assessed the
effects of vaccination against MERS transmission using
SARS data. Third, since the transmission trees were extracted from multiple open-access sources and compiled
by multiple individuals, completeness and effective contact
tracing may have affected transmission patterns.
Our modeling results informed by real outbreak data
support vaccinating patients primarily to prevent the
most cases especially those with chronic diseases that
put them at risk for MERS infection. Since there is still a
significant need for more research on MERS vaccines,
deployment of such a strategy currently is not plausible.
Those infected with MERS tend to be older people with
preexisting conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung
disease, and cancer [31]. Thus, vaccinating patients with
chronic illnesses may prove challenging and in the
absent of a readily available vaccine, however, results
from clinical trials would provide some insight into the
matter. The potential impact of vaccines in the control
of MERS will remain unknown until the vaccines under
study move beyond the preclinical stage and into clinical
trials. Considering that MERS is a continuing threat
among the Gulf countries, the use of the Infection Prevention & Control Manual for GCC countries aids in
the implementation of the first and second vaccination
strategies across these countries in the Middle East, if
HCW vaccination were to be undertaken. Again, before
implementation, without an available vaccine for MERS
to study, cost-effectiveness remains unknown. Without
further research on the above concerns, the ultimate
effect of vaccination is unclear; nonetheless deploying
strategies to achieve an effective vaccination coverage
among hospitalized risk groups appears to be critically
needed for mitigating and preventing MERS outbreaks.

Conclusion
With the use of stochastic simulations and detailed
transmission trees of MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks, we explored the impact of targeted vaccination

Abdirizak et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling

(2019) 16:16

strategies and found that a vaccination strategy targeting
75% of the patients appeared to be the most effective.
While sporadic MERS outbreaks have occurred due to
diagnostic delays and lack of adherence to infection control measures which support super-spreading events, a
vaccine may have a fundamental effect on reducing disease burden in these circumstances by preventing early
transmission events and possibly reducing the risk of future MERS and SARS outbreaks in healthcare settings.
