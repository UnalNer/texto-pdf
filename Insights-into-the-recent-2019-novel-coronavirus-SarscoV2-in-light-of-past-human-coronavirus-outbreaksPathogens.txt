Abstract: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern
since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002. The continuous
evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019
novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019.
Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has
been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand
deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries.
Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be
highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure,
genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present
outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve,
but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with
this continuous threat.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) were discovered in the 1960s and they were classified under family
Coronaviridae, which is the largest family within the order Nidovirales (Figure 1) [1]. Family
Coronaviridae encompasses two subfamilies: subfamily Orthocoronavirinae and subfamily Torovirinae
(Figure 1) [1]. Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae includes four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus,
gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus (Figure 1) [1]. CoVs are typically harbored in mammals and
birds and are common in camels, cattle, cats, bats, and other animals [2]. Alpha and betacoronaviruses
circulate in mammals, including bats (Figure 1) [2]. Gammacoronaviruses mostly infect avian species

however, N protein interacts with the viral RNA and is located in the core of the viral particle, forming
the nucleocapsid [16]. The S protein is a heavily glycosylated protein that forms homotrimeric spikes
on the surface of the viral particle and mediates viral entry into host cells [17]. In some CoVs, each
monomer of the homotimeric S protein exists as two subunits (S1 and S2) on the viral particle due to
cleavage of S protein by host furin-like proteases during viral replication [17,18]. However, in other
CoVs including SARS-CoV, S protein forms S1 and S2 domains, remains intact on viral particles, and
only gets cleaved inside endocytic vesicles during viral entry [19,20].
The M protein is one of the most important proteins in the virion structure. It exists in higher
quantities than any other protein in the viral particle, in contrast to the E protein which is found in
small quantities within the virion [21]. The difference in abundancy may due to the fact that M protein
gives the virus its shape and is critical together with E protein in orchestrating the assembly of the virus
and in forming mature viral envelopes [22]. The E protein also functions in release of viral particles
from host cells, in addition to other functions [22].
The N protein binds the viral RNA and is required for packaging of viral RNA into the viral
particle during viral assembly [23,24]. As mentioned previously, HE is present on the surface of some
betacoronaviruses. It is a hemagglutinin similar to influenza virus hemagglutinin (binds sialic acid
on host cell-surface glycoproteins) and possesses acetyl-esterase activity [25]. HE characteristics may
enhance entry and pathogenesis of coronaviruses that contain such protein in their viral structure.
3. Genome Organization and Replication
The RNA genome of CoVs is the second largest of all RNA viruses, ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases
(kb) in size [26]. The largest genome of all RNA viruses is that of the recently described planarian
secretory cell nidovirus, PSCNV (41.1 kb genome size) [27]. Viral RNA codes for structural and
nonstructural proteins [28]. The structural proteins together with a few nonstructural proteins, with
different functions, are coded within the 30 end of the viral genome [28]. However, the 5’ two-thirds
of the genome codes for nonstructural proteins that are important in viral replication, including
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) [28]. Once the viral genome is inside the host cell
cytoplasm following viral entry, translation of the 50 end of viral RNA produces the RdRP, which uses
viral RNA as a template to generate virus-specific mRNAs (subgenomic mRNAs) from subgenomic
negative strand intermediates [29,30]. Subgenomic mRNAs share the same 30 ends and the same leader
sequence of 70–90 nucleotides at their 50 ends [28,31]. Translation of subgenomic mRNAs leads to
production of structural and nonstructural viral proteins [28]. Once sufficient structural proteins and
genomic viral RNA are formed, viral RNA is then assembled with viral structural proteins into virions.
Viral assembly and budding occur in smooth-walled vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [28].
4. Coronavirus Entry
S protein is the viral protein that mediates the entry of CoVs into host cells [32]. Receptor-binding
domain (RBD) within the S1 domain mediates binding to the cognate host cell receptor; however, the
S2 domain mediates the fusion events, between viral membrane and host cell membrane, that are
required for entry of CoVs into host cells [33,34].
The RBD is located at N-terminus of the S1 subunit as in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or at the
C- terminus as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [34,35]. The tissue tropism of CoVs is determined by
the S protein interaction with the receptors on host cells. Several cellular receptors were described as
receptors for CoVs. For example, aminopeptidase N (APN) was identified as the receptor for several
alphacoronaviruses [36], angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for SARS-CoV [37],
HCoV- NL63 [38] and possibly for the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 [39], CEACAM1 as the receptor
for MHV [40], and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 which is also known as CD26) as the receptor for
MERS-CoV [41].

A study on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed its similarity in structure to that of
SARS-CoV with some key amino acid differences [42]. The previous finding suggests that SARS-CoV-2
could employ human ACE2 as its cellular receptor. A recent study published in Science showed
that SARS-CoV-2 S protein has higher affinity to ACE2 than SARS-CoV S protein [43]. However, the
receptor usage and the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 need further investigation.
The trimeric CoV S protein is cleaved by host cell proteases during infection to expose the fusion
peptide of the S2 domain, which induces the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [18,20,44,45].
Fusion of viral envelope with host cell membrane results in the release of the viral genome into the
cytoplasm [33,34]. Cleavage of S protein occurs at different sites that were identified, in different
coronaviruses, to be between the S1 and S2 domains (S1/S2 site) and within the S2 domain proximal to
the fusion peptide (S20 site) [18,20,44,45]. It is believed that cleavage at both sites is required for viral
entry [46]. Different proteases have been identified to cleave the S1/S2 site depending on its amino
acid sequence in different viruses. For example, the S1/S2 site of MERS-CoV S protein (RSVR↓SV)
is cleaved by furin after its biosynthesis during viral replication [47]. SARS-CoV-2 has an S1/S2 site
(AYT↓M) that is identical to the one in SARS-CoV [48]. This SARS-CoV S1/S2 site has been shown to be
cleaved by cathepsin L following receptor binding and during viral entry in late endosomes [20]. We
believe that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site may be cleaved by cathepsin L similar to SARS-CoV. Other
proteases such as trypsin, elastase, and TMPRSS2 have been shown to cleave SARS-CoV S protein at
other sites between S1 and S2 domains [44,46,49]. Unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has an additional
furin-like protease cleavage site (RRAR↓SV) that is N-terminus to the S1/S2 site (AYT↓M), and is absent
in SARS-CoV [48]. The presence of this furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 suggests its cleavage by
furin during viral egress. In addition to the previous S1/S2 sites, SARS-CoV-2 has a furin-like protease
cleavage S20 site (KR↓SF) that is identical to that in SARS-CoV [48]. However, there is no evidence
that SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved by furin-like proteases at the S20 site during viral egress [20].
Similar to S1/S2 site, we believe that SARS-CoVS protein is cleaved at the S20 site by cathepsin L or
TMPRSS2 in different cellular locations during viral entry. The previous notion is supported by several
studies which showed that cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 promote SARS-CoV entry while their inhibition
suppressed infection of permissive cells [20,44,50]. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has the same S20 site as
SARS-CoV, we believe that processing of SARS-CoV-2 S protein at S20 site is similar to SARS-CoV.
Similarly, MERS-CoV has an S20 site (RXXR↓SA) that is less efficiently cleaved by furin and most
probably cleaved by TMPRSS2 or cathepsin L during viral entry [51]. Despite the identification of
putative protease cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, their relative importance for SARS-CoV-2
S protein activation, viral pathogenesis, and cellular tropism needs further investigation. Antiviral
small molecules that inhibited cathepsin L were able to inhibit SARS-CoV infections in vitro and that
of other viruses that depend on cathepsin L for entry, such as Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses [50].
The presence of a cathepsin L cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S protein (S1/S2 site) suggests that cathepsin
L inhibitors may be valuable in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infections [48]. Antibodies against RBD and S2
domain of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins have been found effective in neutralizing infections
of permissive cell lines in vitro [52–55]. In addition, neutralizing antibodies were capable of treating
infections in experimental animals and in infected patients during these major outbreaks [56–59]. In
one study, several SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies did not bind to SARS-CoV-2 S
protein [43]. Another study showed that the SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibody, CR3022, bound
with high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD [60]. The previous studies suggest that there are differences
between the two RBDs which impact the cross reactivity of many neutralizing antibodies. However,
neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, once developed, could be promising in controlling the
current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

MERS-CoV was first described in 2012 as a new CoV that causes a severe respiratory disease in
Saudi Arabia [13]. Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and
type II pneumocytes and causes severe illness of the respiratory tract, which is characterized by fever,
cough, shortness of breath, and severe complications such as pneumonia and kidney failure [13]. The
incubation period of MERS-CoV is quite similar to SARS-CoV and ranges from 2 to 14 days (Table 1) [66].
As of January 2020 and since 2012, 862 of 2506 infected cases in 27 countries have died (≈35% fatality),
which is more than three times the fatality seen in SARS-CoV infections (Table 1) [67]. However, unlike
SARS-CoV, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is not easy and has not been confirmed except
in cases of very close contact with infected patients in health care settings [67]. MERS-related CoVs
(MERSr-CoVs) were detected in bats, suggesting a potential bat origin (Table 1) [68,69]. MERS-CoV
was transmitted to humans from dromedary camels (Table 1) [70]. Studies have also shown that
camel MERS-CoV strains are almost identical to human MERS-CoV strains [71]. It was postulated that
MERS-CoV existed in camels at least 30 years ago since antibodies to MERS-CoV were detected in
samples that were collected from camels in 1983 [72]. Sequence analyses have shown that MERSr-CoVs’
RBDs share only 60–70% sequence identity with that of human and camel MERS-CoVs [73]. Similar to
the adaptation of SARS-CoV to human host, MERSr-CoVs that are circulating in bats had to undergo
several amino acid changes in RBD of S protein to become capable of infecting camels and humans
(Figure 2) [74]. We believe that the amino acid changes in MERSr-CoVs’ RBD led to the emergence of
MERS-CoV strains that are capable of binding to human DPP4 with high affinity, infecting humans,
and causing the 2012 outbreak (Figure 2).
As mentioned previously, the SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and sequenced from patients that showed
symptoms of respiratory illness and pneumonia in Wuhan, China during December 2019. SARS-CoV-2
is the third identified human CoV that causes severe respiratory illness with symptoms and incubation
period resembling that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (Table 1) [11,75]. Since December 2019,
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates have been rising in China and worldwide [42]. Similar to SARS-CoV and
unlike MERS-CoV, human-to-human transmission has been confirmed [42]. Initial cases of SARS-CoV-2
infections were somehow connected to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province
of China [11]. In this market, a number of nonaquatic animals were on sale, such as birds, snakes,
marmots, bats, and rabbits [11]. Genetic analyses of viral samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2
infections revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that has 88% sequence identity to two
bat SARSr-CoV: 79% identity to SARS-CoV and only 50% identity to MERS-CoV [42]. The previous
findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that is distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but
most probably originated in bats, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [42]. Another recent study
confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 significantly clustered with a sequence from the bat SARS-like CoV that
was isolated in 2015 [76]. However, the existence of an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 is still not
verified (Figure 2).
To date, the fatality of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less than that observed in SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV infections. However, since new cases are confirmed everyday as we write this review, the
fatality of this virus may keep changing and will not be accurately calculated until after the end of this
outbreak. The virus appears to be more fatal in elderly patients or patients with comorbidities [77].
However, it is important to note that there could be cases that went undetected, which makes it hard to
accurately calculate the fatality of this new virus.
6. Insights and Lessons Learned from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 Outbreaks
Our lessons learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks include the high mutation rates
that characterize all RNA viruses [78], the evolving nature of CoVs [6,7], and the ease of transmission
from one species to another [6,7]. As mentioned previously, it appears that SARS- and MERS-CoVs
arose at sometime from ancestral CoVs harbored by bats (Figure 2). Whereas animals served as
intermediate hosts, humans served as terminal hosts (Figure 2). SARS-CoV was transmitted to civets
and raccoon dogs, and to camels in the case of MERS-CoV (Figure 2). They were then transmitted

Pathogens 2020, 9, 186

7 of 15

from these intermediate animal hosts to humans (Figure 2). The practice of eating raw meat and the
close contact between humans and animals are both risk factors for the initiation of a new human
CoV outbreak. This is due to the constant exposure of humans in these cultures to the ever-changing
mutant CoVs.
The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan during
December 2019 [11]. Although other options have not been completely ruled out yet, it is believed that
the SARS-CoV-2 stemmed from a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei
province, China [11]. As for other wet markets in China, live animals are sold, mostly for food or
medicine. The attributed medicinal and/or magical uses of wildlife and rare animal parts (such as
pangolin scales and tiger paws) are mainly based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has
been widely promoted by the current Chinese government. However, it is important to note that
most of these folk remedies are never prescribed in reputable TCM hospitals. The Wuhan market is
known to have a lot of exotic animals and exotic animal parts [42]. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 disease can be
considered a zoonotic disease (like SARS) that has initially spread from animals to humans. However,
human-to-human transmission has also been confirmed [79]. It is not well understood why outbreaks
of CoV infections are mostly occurring in China. We speculate that those viruses may be predominantly
circulating in animals in China rather than other animals in different parts of the world. One of the
reasons for these sudden outbreaks could be the close interactions with live and wild animals that are
consumed as food in wholesale food markets in China.
In a very recent study, the genomes of CoVs isolated from nine patients having viral pneumonia
in Wuhan were analyzed [42]. The study showed that the genomes of these viruses differed by less
than 0.1 percent (more than 99.98% of sequence identity), which indicates that the virus has only
recently emerged in humans and has been detected rapidly after its emergence [42]. As the virus
keeps spreading to more individuals, more mutations may arise which can potentially make the virus
more virulent and thus constant surveillance will be necessary. The U.S. Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) reported that SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness that is characterized
by fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographs of some SARS-CoV-2 patients demonstrated
invasive lesions in both lungs [80]. The CDC also reports that the elderly, individuals with underlying
health problems, and people with compromised immune systems are at a particularly higher risk of
developing severe pneumonia from the virus [77].
We believe that it is too early to assess the impact of the new virus on children. SARS-CoV
infections were significantly less common among children than adults, and kids younger than 12
reported much less severe symptoms than patients who were more than 12 [81]. This may have to do
with children being exposed to more CoV in school and the outdoors than adults or because of the
better overall health status of children as compared to adults. Also, children tend to be more up-to-date
with vaccinations, which may protect them from secondary infections that are often triggered by the
main infections.
During the SARS-CoV outbreak, most schools and factories in China remained open. Following
the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and confirmation of many infected cases, China responded by locking down
residents of Wuhan city, banning wildlife trade until the epidemic is over, and attempting to build
two new hospitals in the city of Wuhan to specifically handle the new outbreak. It is currently unclear
if these two hospitals will be able to handle a major outbreak in a city of 11 million residents. There
is no definite information about the exact time of the start of the outbreak. That is why it is hard to
assess how contagious the virus is (the rate of sustained spread) at the present time. However, it seems
likely and plausible that it is highly contagious, based on the mounting data about human-to-human
transmission outside China [42]. In order to be able to precisely assess the rate of sustained spread,
information about numbers of cases and deaths (the overall number of patients) will need to be divided
by the overall number of people at risk of acquiring the disease (the number of individuals who
have been in contact with the patients). Once this is determined, the overall risk can be assessed.

Pathogens 2020, 9, 186

Underreporting or misdiagnosis of cases can negatively impact the calculations and thus delay the
ability of public health officials to truly assess the situation.
In an outbreak of this magnitude, the most important number that public health experts will be
looking for is the basic reproduction number, also known as the R0 [82]. This number measures the
disease’s potential and represents the average number of people who will catch the disease from one
infected person in a population that has never had the disease in the past [82]. In one study, the mean
estimate of R0 was calculated to be between 2.24 and 3.58 [83]. Another study estimated the R0 to have
a high average value of 2.5 [84], which is consistent with other groups that reported values from 2 to
3 [83,85–88]. These R0 estimates for the SARS-CoV-2 are consistent with R0 estimates for SARS- and
MERS-CoVs (from 2 to 5) (Table 1) [89,90]. The virus is less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10%
of the infected patients. Because R0 represents an average, outliers (carriers who infect so many people
or carriers who infect nobody) can have a huge impact on the final value of the R0. In other words, a
bigger R0 does not necessarily mean more infections. For example, the R0 for the seasonal flu typically
ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 [91], but it still infected many more people than the number of people who got
infected with SARS-CoV. At any rate, any R0 above 1 should be taken seriously. The goal will be to
reduce the R0 to a value that is below 1. Finally, R0 estimates can be higher than the “true” R0 values
because of two main reasons: infected people who did not show symptoms and infected people who
did not report their symptoms. Since R0 is not an intrinsic property of the virus itself, R0 estimates
tend to be lower in places where there are sound infection control methods and vice versa. Typically,
R0 estimates are highest at the beginning of an outbreak and then subside gradually once countries
become aware of the outbreak and manage to put in effective control measures to prevent the spread of
the virus.
The lockdown strategy that China is implementing works best during the early stages of an
infection, which is not the case in Wuhan, as there are several million people who already left the city
before the restrictions were imposed. If we are beyond the early stages, then there can be disadvantages
associated with such lockdown on Wuhan. Among the disadvantages are people evading care to avoid
any restrictions on their life.
Given that the incubation period can be up to 11 days or more, a two-week federal quarantine
was ordered for 195 U.S. citizens who were flown back from China [92]. The action was described by
the CDC as precautionary and preventive. For comparison, there were no quarantines ordered in the
U.S. for the recent SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV outbreaks. The last federal quarantine in the U.S. was
ordered back in the 1963 to prevent the spread of smallpox from Sweden to the U.S. during a smallpox
outbreak in Sweden [93].
7. Protective Measures to Prevent Spread of the Disease
As shown in Table 1, the number of people infected by the virus has exceeded the global total
infected with SARS-CoV (8098 individuals) in a nine-month period that extended from 2002 until 2003.
It will be difficult to control the disease without a level of disruption of air travel. We believe that
limiting travel to and from China will be a necessary measure.
Respiratory viruses spread through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected
person coughs or sneezes. The exact modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are not entirely clear at
this early stage, but reports of healthcare professionals in China who contracted the disease suggest
a highly contagious virus [77]. Prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 infections entail precautions that are
common to other respiratory viruses. The most obvious measure is to avoid contact with people who
are sick. This is especially important due to the contagious nature of the virus. If someone is sick,
they should stay home. Once they recover, they may consider using disposable face masks (while
frequently changing them) and avoiding close contact with coworkers. However, the value of wearing
face masks is controversial, to say the least [94]. Surgical masks do not fully protect against airborne
viruses as they do not fully seal the nose and the mouth. Thus, small droplets, which can travel farther
than large droplets and in more unpredictable patterns, can be inhaled around the sides of the masks.

Pathogens 2020, 9, 186

The N95 masks offer a better protection as long as they fit properly. It is worth noting that N95 masks
are not suitable for people with facial hair [95].
Being an enveloped virus, washing hands with water and soap for at least 30 s would be beneficial
in deactivating the SARS-CoV-2 [96]. Hand sanitizers can also be used if water and soap are not readily
available, while touching eyes, nose, and mouth should be prevented [97].
Disinfection of different environmental surfaces, tools, and objects is crucial in limiting the spread
of the virus [97]. The more you use one of these objects or touch one of these surfaces, the more
pressing cleaning and disinfection become.
Public health officials, local health departments, hospitals, doctors, and CDC personnel should
work closely with universities and other workplaces to educate and provide needed supplies to contain
the spread of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 as a public
health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 [98]. A PHEIC is an atypical
event that constitutes a public health risk and potential for the disease to spread to other countries,
thus requiring a coordinated international response [99]. This designation could help mobilize more
resources to the impacted areas. The current outbreak represents the sixth time the WHO has declared
a global emergency since it gained the power to declare an international emergency in 2005 [100].
The previous five times were the 2009 H1N1 swine flu, the 2013 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the
2014 polio outbreak, the 2016 Zika outbreak, and 2019 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of
Congo [100]. None of these previous emergencies led a worldwide pandemic. However, we predict
that the current outbreak is more likely to become a pandemic.
The current diagnostic test for the virus is PCR-based [101]. Since this test typically takes 48 h, a
new quicker diagnostic test needs to be developed. It will not be practical to isolate (quarantine) a
large number of individuals until results of the PCR-based diagnostic test become available. This can
also overwhelm healthcare facilities, already overwhelmed by the increasing number of cases that are
discovered every day in China and elsewhere in the world.
Containing the outbreak before it can spread is the best way to prevent pandemics. Border closures
and screening at airports and checkpoints are classical measures that were previously implemented in
the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic [102]. This can reduce the spread of the virus but will not be a fool-proof
strategy. The reason is that the incubation period of the virus is believed to be as long as 14 days,
as was the case with MERS-CoV [103,104]. This means that carriers of the virus can show up at the
border with no apparent symptoms and readily pass through security without raising any red flags.
Compared to the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, the current increase in air traffic in China and worldwide
has likely contributed to the more rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.
Without a quick diagnostic test, there are not many good options that can completely stop
the transmission of the virus. Once a test is available, cases can be identified and isolated. Based
on previous genetic experience with SARS-CoV, scientists will need to quickly develop a vaccine
for SARS-CoV-2.
The world is hoping to succeed in containing this virus as soon as possible. Even after success,
there needs to be follow-up with patients who are cured and declared virus-free. This is a lesson we
learned from the Ebola outbreak, in which some patients who walked out from the hospital “virus-free”
were found later to harbor the Ebola virus that was carefully hiding itself in other parts of the body, such
as the immune-privileged eye [105–107]. Although this hidden Ebola virus was no longer transmissible
to other humans, it rendered the label “virus-free” incorrect with these individuals.
8. Concluding Remarks
Natural disasters bring people together but epidemics and outbreaks split them apart. The
SARS-CoV-2 is another CoV that may lead to a pandemic, if not timely controlled. Our current
knowledge of this virus suggests an intermediate host; however, human-to-human transmission is
confirmed and is of concern. The number of infected cases to date indicates a very rapid and efficient
human-to-human transmission. This necessitates quick development of therapeutics that can inhibit

this viral infection. Neutralizing antibodies and vaccines could play significant roles in controlling the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
