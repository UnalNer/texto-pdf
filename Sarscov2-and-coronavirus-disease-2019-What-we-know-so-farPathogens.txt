In December 2019, a cluster of fatal pneumonia cases presented in Wuhan, China. They were
caused by a previously unknown coronavirus. All patients had been associated with the Wuhan
Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold. The virus spread rapidly and public
health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried
the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread
media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular
information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel
coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to
the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus,
understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors,
and work on vaccine development. Here we present a summary of current knowledge regarding
the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes.

Coronaviruses, named for the crown-like spikes on their surface (Latin: corona = crown), are
positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the Coronvirinae subfamily, in the Coronaviridae family of
the Nidovirales order [1]. They have four main subgroups—alpha, beta, gamma, and delta—based
on their genomic structure. Alpha- and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals, usually causing
respiratory symptoms in humans and gastroenteritis in other animals [2,3]. Until December of 2019,
only six different coronaviruses were known to infect humans. Four of these (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E,
HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) usually caused mild common cold-type symptoms in immunocompetent
people and the other two have caused pandemics in the past two decades. In 2002–2003, the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a SARS epidemic that resulted in a 10% mortality.
Similarly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a devastating
pandemic in 2012 with a 37% mortality rate.
In late 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China were identified
as with a novel betacoronavirus, first called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) and often referred
to as the Wuhan coronavirus. When the genomics of the 2019-nCov was sequenced, it shared 79.5% of

the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV that caused the 2002–2003 pandemic [4] and the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed the 2019-nCov as SARS-CoV-2 [5]. Patients began to
present in November and December with various degrees of respiratory distress of unknown etiology
and treated at the time as possible influenza infections. As it became apparent that most cases had
a shared history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (the so-called “wet market”),
the Wuhan local health authority issued an epidemiologic alert on 30 December 2019 and the wet
market was closed. About a week later, on 9 January 2020, Chinese researchers shared the full
genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2 [6]. Since the novel coronavirus
was recognized, the disease it caused was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19), and several
reports on the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and treatment strategies have been published [7–10].
In addition, several websites have been setup to track the epidemic and the case detection rate, which
are being updated as often as hourly [11–14]. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global public health emergency, sixth after H1N1 (2009),
polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(2019), and on 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic [15]. The timeline of
events is summarized in Figure 1.

the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients diagnosed to that day, and the red bar the cumulative
