In late December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel
Coronavirus pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China,
aroused worldwide concern. Previous studies have reported epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this brief
review is to summarize those published studies as of late
February 2020 on the clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of COVID-19 and help provide
guidance for frontline medical staff in the clinical management of this outbreak.

causing 2700 deaths. Mainland China, and especially Hubei
Province, has borne the brunt of the epidemic, reporting
77,780 cases. Outside of mainland China, 33 countries have
reported 2549 confirmed infections and 34 fatalities.3
We reviewed the published clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of patients with COVID-19 to help
health workers around the world combat the current outbreak.
We searched PubMed for all published articles regarding
COVID-19 up to February 19, 2020. Keywords used were
“COVID-19,” “2019 novel coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2,”
“2019-nCoV,” “Wuhan coronavirus,” and “Wuhan seafood
market pneumonia virus.” After careful screening, six published articles with confirmed cases were identified and included in this review. The summary of included clinical studies is shown in Table 1.

INTRODUCTION

In December 31, 2019, hospitals reported a cluster of cases
with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, China,
attracting great attention nationally and worldwide.1 On January 1, 2020, Wuhan public health authorities shut down the
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where wild and live
animals were sold, due to a suspected link with the outbreak.
On January 7, 2020, researchers rapidly isolated a novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as 2019-nCoV)
from confirmed infected pneumonia patients. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
next-generation sequencing were used to characterize it.2 On
January 23, 2020, owing to the large flow of people during the
Chinese Spring Festival, public transport was suspended in
Wuhan and, eventually, in all the cities in Hubei Province to
reduce the risk of further transmission.
The number of RT-PCR–confirmed cases has increased
rapidly. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared COVID-19 (as it would be officially known
as of February 11) to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and declared an epidemic. As of
February 24, 2020, 80,239 cases were confirmed worldwide
Received February 24, 2020
Revised February 26, 2020
Accepted February 27, 2020

NATURAL HISTORY AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Huang et al.4 first reported clinical features of 41 patients
confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on January 2,
2020, which include 13 ICU cases and 28 non-ICU cases.
More than half of the cases (66%) had been exposed to the
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Almost all the patients
had bilateral lung ground glass opacity on computed tomography imaging. The initial symptoms included fever (98%),
cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), myalgia or fatigue (44%), sputum production (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and
diarrhea (3%). Only one patient did not present fever in the
early stage of disease. Twelve (29%) cases progressed to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 5 (12%) had acute
cardiac injury, 3 (7%) had acute kidney injury (AKI), and 3
(7%) had shock. At the data cutoff date, 28 (68%) patients
were discharged and 6 (15%) had died.
On January 20, 2020, Chen et al.5 reported 99 cases with
SARS-CoV-2–infected pneumonia. This case series revealed
that older males with comorbidities as a result of weaker
immune function were the most susceptible to COVID-19
incidence. The symptoms, complications, and treatments in
this study were similar to the previous published study by
Huang and colleagues.4 At the data cutoff date, 31 (31%) were
discharged and 11 (11%) died, and 57 (58%) of the patients

were still hospitalized. A study of Li et al.6 reported on 425
COVID-19 cases in Wuhan confirmed between January 1 and
22, 2020. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days, with the
95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days, though uncertainty remains.
Two subsequent studies confirmed the pattern of signs and
symptoms.7, 8 At the time of this writing, the most recent
published case series9 of 138 confirmed cases included 36
requiring intensive care by the data cutoff date of February
3, 2020. It also found the common presenting symptoms of
fever (136, 99%), fatigue (96, 70%), and dry cough (82, 59%),
though there were two patients who did not present any signs
of fever at the onset of illness. A higher proportion of cases
presented with gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea
and nausea (14, 10%) than in previous series. Forty-seven
(34%) were discharged while 6 (4%) died, while the remainder
were still hospitalized. The organ failure complications were
similar to the original studies.
Taken together, these studies indicate the main clinical
manifestations of COVID-19 are fever (90% or more), cough
(around 75%), and dyspnea (up to 50%). A small but significant subset has gastrointestinal symptoms. Preliminary estimates of case fatality, likely to fall as better early diagnostic
efforts come into play, is about 2%, mostly due to ARDS,
AKI, and myocardial injury.

BASIC VIROLOGY

Coronaviruses are widespread in humans and several other
vertebrates and cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. Notably, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 have caused
human epidemics. Comparison with the current virus shows
several significant differences and similarities. Both MERSCoV and SARS-CoV have much higher case fatality rates
(40% and 10%, respectively). Though the current SARSCoV-2 shares 79% of its genome with SARS-CoV, it appears
to be much more transmissible.10
Both SARS-CoVs enter the cell via the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.11, 12 The SARS-Cov2 first predominantly infects lower airways and binds to ACE2
on alveolar epithelial cells. Both viruses are potent inducers of
inflammatory cytokines. The “cytokine storm” or “cytokine
cascade” is the postulated mechanism for organ damage. The
virus activates immune cells and induces the secretion of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines into pulmonary vascular endothelial cells.

TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS AND PROTECTIVE
MEASURES

The preliminary estimate of R0 (the expected number of cases
directly produced by one person in a population susceptible to

Jiang et al.: Review of Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019

infection) for COVID-19 is 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).6 Fomites
are suspected as the main source of infectious particles, though
some uncertainty remains. Other coronaviruses have been
shown to persist for days on uncleaned surfaces.10 Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the stool specimen in
a person who had symptoms while the serum specimen tested
negative.13 Recently, SARS-Cov-2 was isolated from a swab
sample of a confirmed patient’s feces by Chinese researchers,14 indicating the potential for fecal-oral transmission. Studies have shown effective person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV even in the presence of isolation efforts in
medical facilities.15, 16 A case series of nine infected pregnant
women did not reveal evidence of third trimester vertical
transmission after cesarian section.17 Transmission in health
settings is a very serious threat. The most recent case series
reported 57 (41%) of 138 patients were infected hospital
settings, including 40 (29%) medical staff.9 While further
study is needed, it appears that asymptomatic persons are also
potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection.18, 19
Handwashing is the mainstay of viral control. Contact isolation gear such as masks, gowns, and gloves are also recommended. Transmission via ocular surface is possible,20 so eye
protection should also be used.

and symptomatic, though trials of vaccines and antivirals are
underway. Healthcare providers should follow subsequent
reports as the situation will likely change rapidly.

VACCINES AND TREATMENTS

Several efforts to develop vaccines are underway, but the
WHO estimates it will take 18 months for the COVID-19
vaccines to be available.21 At present, most treatment is symptomatic and supportive, though anti-inflammatory and antiviral treatments have been employed. Supportive treatment for
complicated patients has included continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), invasive mechanical ventilation, and
even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). No
specific antiviral drugs have been confirmed effective. The
first reported patient with 2019-nCoV infection in the USA
was treated with remdesivir, 13 and others have used
antiretrovirals like ritonavir, with trials of both in progress.22
A recent study conducted by the “front-line” health care
providers combating COVID-19 in Wuhan indicated that systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefit.23 Baricitinib has been suggested as a potential drug for the
treatment in the hope that it might reduce the process of both
virus invasion and inflammation.24

CONCLUSION

Despite some diversity in initial symptoms, most COVID-19
patients have fever and respiratory symptoms. For now, travel
history to epidemic areas is important to the diagnosis and
should be obtained on all patients with flu-like syndromes. If
positive, timely referral to the public health authorities for
testing is crucial. Frontline medical staff are at risk and should
employ protective measures. Treatment is mainly supportive
