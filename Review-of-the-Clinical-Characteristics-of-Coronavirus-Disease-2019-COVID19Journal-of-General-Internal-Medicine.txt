In late December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel
Coronavirus pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China,
aroused worldwide concern. Previous studies have reported epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this brief
review is to summarize those published studies as of late
February 2020 on the clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of COVID-19 and help provide
guidance for frontline medical staff in the clinical management of this outbreak.

causing 2700 deaths. Mainland China, and especially Hubei
Province, has borne the brunt of the epidemic, reporting
77,780 cases. Outside of mainland China, 33 countries have
reported 2549 confirmed infections and 34 fatalities.3
We reviewed the published clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of patients with COVID-19 to help
health workers around the world combat the current outbreak.
We searched PubMed for all published articles regarding
COVID-19 up to February 19, 2020. Keywords used were
“COVID-19,” “2019 novel coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2,”
“2019-nCoV,” “Wuhan coronavirus,” and “Wuhan seafood
market pneumonia virus.” After careful screening, six published articles with confirmed cases were identified and included in this review. The summary of included clinical studies is shown in Table 1.

In December 31, 2019, hospitals reported a cluster of cases
with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, China,
attracting great attention nationally and worldwide.1 On January 1, 2020, Wuhan public health authorities shut down the
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where wild and live
animals were sold, due to a suspected link with the outbreak.
On January 7, 2020, researchers rapidly isolated a novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as 2019-nCoV)
from confirmed infected pneumonia patients. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
next-generation sequencing were used to characterize it.2 On
January 23, 2020, owing to the large flow of people during the
Chinese Spring Festival, public transport was suspended in
Wuhan and, eventually, in all the cities in Hubei Province to
reduce the risk of further transmission.
The number of RT-PCR–confirmed cases has increased
rapidly. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared COVID-19 (as it would be officially known
as of February 11) to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and declared an epidemic. As of
February 24, 2020, 80,239 cases were confirmed worldwide

Huang et al.4 first reported clinical features of 41 patients
confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on January 2,
2020, which include 13 ICU cases and 28 non-ICU cases.
More than half of the cases (66%) had been exposed to the
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Almost all the patients
had bilateral lung ground glass opacity on computed tomography imaging. The initial symptoms included fever (98%),
cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), myalgia or fatigue (44%), sputum production (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and
diarrhea (3%). Only one patient did not present fever in the
early stage of disease. Twelve (29%) cases progressed to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 5 (12%) had acute
cardiac injury, 3 (7%) had acute kidney injury (AKI), and 3
(7%) had shock. At the data cutoff date, 28 (68%) patients
were discharged and 6 (15%) had died.
On January 20, 2020, Chen et al.5 reported 99 cases with
SARS-CoV-2–infected pneumonia. This case series revealed
that older males with comorbidities as a result of weaker
immune function were the most susceptible to COVID-19
incidence. The symptoms, complications, and treatments in
this study were similar to the previous published study by
Huang and colleagues.4 At the data cutoff date, 31 (31%) were
discharged and 11 (11%) died, and 57 (58%) of the patients
