Supplemental content
IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that

was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk factors for
the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated.
OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19

pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with
confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between
December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13,
2020.
EXPOSURES Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological,
demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also
collected and analyzed.
RESULTS Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and
128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those
84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did
not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%]
patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such
as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively
[difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117
[5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox
regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression
from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR,
6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08;
95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate
dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and
D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High
fever (ⱖ39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI,
1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with
ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI,
0.20-0.72).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Older age was associated with greater risk of development of
ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was
associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes
among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial
for patients who develop ARDS.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Death in Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China

S

evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China and has subsequently spread to other regions of
China and 37 countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and France.1 SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to a unique
clade of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, was identified as the pathogen of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020.2
As reported by Huang et al,3 patients with COVID-19 present primarily with fever, myalgia or fatigue, and dry cough.
Although most patients are thought to have a favorable prognosis, older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may have worse outcomes. Patients with severe illness may develop dyspnea and hypoxemia within 1 week after
onset of the disease, which may quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure.4 Certain epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of
COVID-19 have been previously reported.3-5 However, these
studies were based on relatively small sample sizes, and risk
factors leading to poor clinical outcomes have not been well
delineated. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics and factors associated with developing ARDS after hospital admission and progression from ARDS to death in patients
with COVID-19 pneumonia from a single hospital in Wuhan,
China.

Methods
Study Population
This is a retrospective cohort study of 201 patients aged 21 to
83 years with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at
Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia according to World Health
Organization interim guidance.6 According to hospital data, patients were admitted from December 25, 2019, to January 26,
2020. Of 201 patients, 10 have been described previously by
Chen et al4 and Huang et al.3 The ethics committee of Jinyintan Hospital approved this study and granted a waiver of informed consent from study participants.

Key Points
Question What clinical characteristics are associated with the
development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
progression from ARDS to death among patients with coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia?
Findings In this cohort study involving 201 patients with
confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, risk factors associated with the
development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death
included older age, neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation
dysfunction. Treatment with methylprednisolone may be
beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.
Meaning Risk for developing ARDS included factors consistent
with immune activation; older age was associated with both ARDS
development and death, likely owing to less robust immune
responses.

ences, and Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences) as described previously.4 Other respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and influenza B virus, were
also detected by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase
chain reaction assays in 173 patients. Possible bacterial or fungal pathogens were detected by sputum culture. Additionally, patients underwent blood routine blood test, coagulation, and biochemical tests and chest x-rays or computed
tomography. The most intense level of oxygen support during hospitalization (nasal cannula, noninvasive mechanical
ventilation [NMV], invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], or
IMV with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) was
recorded. The majority of the clinical data used in this study
was collected from the first day of hospital admission unless
indicated otherwise. To minimize interference of treatment
during hospitalization, the highest patient temperature was defined using the self-reported highest temperature prior to hospital admission. Older age was classified as 65 years or older.
Fever and high fever were classified as 37.3 °C or higher and
39 °C or higher, respectively.

Outcomes
Procedures
A trained team of physicians and medical students reviewed
and collected epidemiological, clinical, and outcomes data from
electronic medical records. Patients were followed up to February 13, 2020. The individual components of all definitions
of clinical outcomes were recorded separately and checked by
2 authors (C.W. and X.C.). Patient confidentiality was protected by assigning a deidentified patient identification, and
the electronic data was stored in a locked, passwordprotected computer.
To identify SARS-CoV-2 infection, throat swab samples
were obtained from all patients at admission and tested using
real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays according to the same protocol described previously.3 The
pathogenic detection was determined in 4 institutions (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Medical SciE2

Two outcomes were evaluated: development of ARDS and
death among those with ARDS. World Health Organization interim guidance was used to define ARDS.6

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses of the variables were expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]), or number (%). Differences in
distributions of patient characteristics by outcome subgroups are reported using differences with 95% CIs. Categorical data were compared using the χ2 test or the Fisher exact
test. Nonnormal distributed continuous data were compared
using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test.
Bivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were
used to determine HRs and 95% CIs between individual factors on the development of ARDS or progression from ARDS
to death. Sample size varied because of missing data (summarized in Tables 1 and 2). Survival curves were developed using

A total of 201 patients were included in this study (Table 1).
The median age was 51 years (IQR, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%)
were male. The most commonly self-reported symptoms at onset of illness were fever (n = 188 [93.5%]), cough (n = 163
[81.1%]), productive cough (n = 83 [41.3%]), dyspnea (n = 80
[39.8%]), and fatigue or myalgia (n = 65 [32.3%]). The majority (n = 154 [76.6%]) of patients had fever with cough; 74
(36.8%) had fever with dyspnea; 66 (32.8%) had fever with fatigue, myalgia, or headache; and only 13 (6.5%) presented with
fever alone (eTable 1 in the Supplement). A total of 191 (95.0%)
patients had findings of bilateral infiltrates on radiographic
imaging, while 10 (5.0%) patients had unilateral infiltrates.
Sixty-six (32.8%) patients had comorbidities, including hypertension (n = 39 [19.4%]), diabetes (n = 22 [10.9%]), liver disease (n = 7 [3.5%]), nervous system disease (n = 7 [3.5%]),
chronic lung disease (n = 5 [2.5%]), chronic kidney disease
(n = 2 [1.0%]), endocrine system diseases not including diabetes (n = 2 [1.0%]), and tumors (n = 1 [0.5%]). Most (n = 173
[86.1%]) patients were tested for 9 additional respiratory pathogens. Bacteria and fungi cultures were collected from 148
(73.6%) patients. Only 1 patient was coinfected with influenza A virus.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Death in Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China

67 (33.3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 44 (21.9%)
died. Among the 67 patients who received mechanical ventilation, 44 (65.7%) died, 14 (20.9%) were discharged from the
hospital, and 9 (13.4%) remained hospitalized. The median time
from admission to developing ARDS was 2 days (IQR, 1-4 days).
All of the patients who died had developed ARDS and received mechanical ventilation.
Table 3 demonstrates that when compared with patients
without ARDS, patients with ARDS were older (difference, 12.0
years; 95% CI, 8.0-16.0 years; P < .001) and had higher temperature prior to admission (difference, 0.30 °C; 95% CI, 0.000.50 °C; P = .004). More patients with ARDS presented with
initial symptoms of dyspnea compared with those without
ARDS (difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%; P < .001). Compared with patients without ARDS, patients with ARDS had a
higher proportion of comorbidities, including hypertension
(difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%; P = .02) and diabetes
(difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%; P = .002). In addition, when compared with patients who did not have ARDS,
patients who developed ARDS were less likely to be treated with
antiviral therapy (difference, −14.4%; 95% CI, −26.0% to −2.9%;
P = .005) and more likely to be treated with methylprednisolone (difference, 49.3%; 95% CI, 36.4%-62.1%; P < .001). Of 84
patients with ARDS, 61 (72.6%) received NMV, 17 (20.2%) received nasal cannula, 5 (6.0%) received IMV, and 1 (1.2%) received IMV with ECMO.
Compared with patients without ARDS, for patients with
ARDS, the value of liver damage indices (total bilirubin [difference, 1.90 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.60-3.30 mg/dL; P = .004]), renal dysfunction indices (urea [difference, 1.69 mM; 95% CI,
1.10-2.29 mM; P < .001]), inflammation-related indices (interleukin-6 [IL-6] [difference, 0.93 pg/L; 95% CI, 0.07-1.98 pg/L;
P = .03]), and coagulation function indices (D-dimer [difference, 0.52 μg/mL; 95% CI, 0.21-0.94 μg/mL; P < .001]) were
significantly elevated. However, lymphocyte counts (difference, −0.34 ×109/mL; 95% CI, −0.47 to −0.22 ×109/mL; P < .001)
and CD8 T cells (difference, −66.00 cells/μL; 95% CI, −129.00
to −7.00 cells/μL; P = .03) were significantly decreased.
As summarized in Table 4, older age (≥65 years old), high
fever (≥39 °C), comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes), neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia (as well as lower CD3 and CD4 Tcell counts), elevated end-organ related indices (eg, AST, urea,
LDH), elevated inflammation-related indices (highsensitivity C-reactive protein and serum ferritin), and elevated coagulation function–related indicators (PT and Ddimer) were significantly associated with higher risks of the
development of ARDS. Patients who received treatment with
methylprednisolone appear to have been sicker than patients
who did not receive it. Specifically, a higher proportion of patients who received methylprednisolone were classified into
a higher grade on the Pneumonia Severity Index7 compared
with patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (P = .01;
eTable 2 in the Supplement).
In the subgroup of patients who developed ARDS, patients who ultimately died were older (difference, 18.0 years;
95% CI, 13.0-23.0 years; P < .001) and had lower proportion of
high fever (difference, −31.8%; 95% CI, −56.5% to −7.1%;
P = .007) than those who survived. They also had higher projamainternalmedicine.com

portions of hypertension (difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, −2.0% to
39.7%; P = .05). The patients who died were less likely to be
treated with antiviral therapy (difference, −40.7%; 95% CI,
−58.5% to −22.9%; P < .001). Regarding the most intense level
of oxygen support among the 44 ARDS patients who died, 38
(86.4%) received NMV, 5 (11.4%) received IMV, and 1 (2.3%) received IMV with ECMO.
For patients with ARDS who died, the value of liver damage indices (total bilirubin [difference, 2.60 mg/dL; 95% CI,
0.30-5.20 mg/dL; P = .03]), renal dysfunction indices (urea [difference, 1.50 mM; 95% CI, 0.50-2.70 mM; P = .004]), inflammation-related indices (IL-6 [difference, 3.88 pg/L; 95% CI,
2.20-6.13 pg/L; P < .001]), and coagulation function indices (Ddimer [difference, 2.10 μg/mL; 95% CI, 0.89-5.27 μg/mL;
P = .001]) were significantly elevated compared with patients with ARDS who survived. However, lymphocyte counts
(difference, −0.23 ×109/mL; 95% CI, −0.41 to −0.07 ×109/mL;
P = .004) and CD8 T cells (difference, −134 cells/μL; 95% CI,
−221 to −10 cells/μL; P = .05) were significantly decreased
(Table 3).
Bivariate Cox models showed that several factors
related to the development of ARDS were not associated
with death, which included comorbidities, lymphocyte
counts, CD3 and CD4 T-cell counts, AST, prealbumin, creatinine, glucose, low-density lipoprotein, serum ferritin, and
PT. However, IL-6 was statistically significantly associated
with death (Table 4). Although high fever was associated
with higher likelihood of developing ARDS (HR, 1.77; 95%
CI, 1.11-2.84), it was negatively associated with death (HR,
0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82).
Finally, among the patients with ARDS, of those who received methylprednisolone treatment, 23 of 50 (46.0%) patients died, while of those who did not receive methylprednisolone treatment, 21 of 34 (61.8%) died. The administration
of methylprednisolone appears to have reduced the risk of
death in patients with ARDS (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72;
P = .003) (Figure).

Discussion
In this cohort study, we reported the clinical characteristics and
risk factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ARDS after admission,
as well as those who progressed from ARDS to death. Patients
who received methylprednisolone treatment were much more
likely to develop ARDS likely owing to confounding by indication; specifically, sicker patients were more likely to be given
methylprednisolone. However, administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in patients with
ARDS. These findings suggest that for patients with COVID-19
pneumonia, methylprednisolone treatment may be beneficial for those who have developed ARDS on disease progression. However, these results should be interpreted with caution owing to potential bias and residual confounding in this
observational study with a small sample size. Doubleblinded randomized clinical trials should be conducted to validate these results.

Coagulation function

The risk factors related to the development of ARDS and
progression from ARDS to death included older age, neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher LDH
and D-dimer). In addition, we observed that several factors associated with the development of ARDS were not associated
with death (eg, comorbidities, lymphocyte counts, CD3 and
CD4 T-cell counts, AST, prealbumin, creatinine, glucose, lowdensity lipoprotein, serum ferritin, PT). Moreover, the difference in median D-dimer between the death and survival groups
was larger than that between the ARDS and non-ARDS groups,
which suggests that disseminated intravascular coagulation
E8

was on the pathway to death in some patients. Interestingly,
although high fever was positively associated with development of ARDS, it was negatively related to death, which is consistent with results noted in a study by Schell-Chaple et al.8
However, the differences in patient temperature between the
groups were very small and self-reported before hospital admission, thus the data regarding high fever should be cautiously interpreted.
The pathogenesis of highly pathogenic human coronavirus is still not completely understood. Cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses are thought to play

share the same cell entry receptors with SARS-CoV-2,17,18 could
infect immune cells, including T lymphocytes, monocytes, and
macrophages.19 The CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell counts decreased
at the onset of illness; this decrease persisted until the recovery
period of SARS-CoV pneumonia.19 In addition, CD4 and CD8 T-cell
counts decreased in the peripheral blood specimen of patients
withfatalSARS-CoVpneumonia10,20,21,whichwasconsistentwith
these results that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS
presented with lymphocytopenia (CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells).
Studies demonstrated that T-cell responses can inhibit the overactivation of innate immunity.22 T cells were reported to help clear
SARS-CoV, and a suboptimal T-cell response was found to cause
pathological changes observed in mice with SARS-CoV.23 We hypothesized that persistent and gradual increases in lymphocyte
responses might be required for effective immunity against SARSCoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to characterize the
role of the neutrophil and lymphocyte response or that of CD4 and
CD8 T-cell immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Administration of methylprednisolone reduced the risk of death (hazard ratio,
0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72; P = .003).

Limitations
important roles in disease severity.9 Neutrophilia was found in
both the peripheral blood10 and lung11 of patients with SARS-CoV.
The severity of lung damage correlated with extensive pulmonary
infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages and higher numbers
of these cells in the peripheral blood in patients with Middle East
respiratory syndrome.12-14 Neutrophils are the main source of
chemokines and cytokines. The generation of cytokine storm can
lead to ARDS, which is a leading cause of death in patients with
severe acute respiratory syndrome15 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome.14 In this study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
who had developed ARDS had significantly higher neutrophil
counts than did those without ARDS, perhaps leading to the activation of neutrophils to execute an immune response against
the virus, but also contributing to cytokine storm. This may partly
explain the positive association of high fever and ARDS found at
the early stages of COVID-19. In addition, considering that older
age is associated with declined immune competence,16 the results
of the present study showed that older age was associated with
both ARDS and death. Therefore, older age related to death may
be due to less robust immune responses.
The results of this study show that higher CD3 and CD4 T-cell
counts might protect patients from developing ARDS, but similar results were not observed when examined for death, possibly because of limited sample size. CD8 counts were significantly
higher in those who were alive. These results indicate the important roles of CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID-19 pneumonia. Earlier studies have revealed that SARS-CoV, which was reported to

This study has several limitations. First, owing to limited medical resources, only patients with relatively severe COVID-19
pneumonia were hospitalized during this period. Second, this
study was conducted at a single-center hospital with limited
sample size. As such, this study may have included disproportionately more patients with poor outcomes. There may also
be a selection bias when identifying factors that influence the
clinical outcomes. A larger cohort study of patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia from Wuhan, China, other cities in China,
and other countries would help to further define the clinical
characteristics and risk factors of the disease.

Conclusions
Older age was associated with greater risk of developing ARDS
and death, likely because of less rigorous immune response.
Although fever was associated with the development of ARDS,
it was also associated with better outcomes. Several factors related to the development of ARDS were not associated with
death, which indicates that different pathophysiological
changes from hospital admission to development of ARDS and
from development of ARDS to death may exist. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS. Double-blinded randomized clinical trials to determine the most effective treatments for
COVID-19 are still needed.
