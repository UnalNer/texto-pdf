Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ﬁrst emerged in 2012, and over 2000 infections and
800 deaths have been conﬁrmed in 27 countries. However, to date, no commercial vaccine is available. In this
study, structural proteins of MERS-CoV were expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells for the development of
vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV and diagnostic methods. The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV lacking its
transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (SΔTM) was secreted into the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using a
bombyxin signal peptide and puriﬁed using aﬃnity chromatography. The puriﬁed SΔTM forms small nanoparticles as well as the full-length S protein and has the ability to bind human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4),
which is a receptor of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that bioactive SΔTM was expressed in silkworm larvae.
To produce MERS-CoV-like particles (MERS-CoV-LPs), the coexpression of spike proteins was performed in Bm5
cells and envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins secreted E and M proteins extracellularly, suggesting that
MERS-CoV-LPs may be formed. However, this S protein was not displayed on virus-like particles (VLPs) even
though E and M proteins were secreted into the culture supernatant. By surfactant treatment and mechanical
extrusion using S protein- or three structural protein-expressing Bm5 cells, S protein-displaying nanovesicles
with diameters of approximately 100-200 nm were prepared and conﬁrmed by immuno-TEM. The mechanical
extrusion method is favorable for obtaining uniform recombinant protein-displaying nanovesicles from cultured
cells. The puriﬁed SΔTM from silkworm larvae and S protein-displaying nanovesicles from Bm5 cells may lead to
the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and the diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which ﬁrst emerged in
Saudi Arabia in 2012, is caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Over 2000 infections have been conﬁrmed in 27 countries, and 800
deaths have occurred (WHO, 2019). MERS-CoV is a single positivestranded RNA virus and belongs to the group C species of beta-coronavirus (Chan et al., 2012). Bats are the natural reservoir of MERSCoV, and camels are its intermediate host (Memish et al., 2013; Wang
et al., 2014). MERS-CoV may spread to humans through camels and
may be transmitted from human to human (Health Protection Agency
(HPA) and UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation team, 2013).
MERS-CoV contains four structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope,
(E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, which
is a class I fusion protein, is responsible for viral entry into target cells

through receptor binding. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) is
known to be its receptor. During viral infection, S protein is processed
into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding
domain, and the S2 subunit is required for the membrane fusion of
MERS-CoV. Therefore, the S protein is one of the targets for the development of MERS-CoV therapeutics (Du et al., 2017). Some neutralizing antibodies have been developed against the receptor-binding
domain of S protein, which blocks the interaction of S protein with
DDP4, to inhibit the infection of cells by MERS-CoV (Corti et al., 2015;
Jiang et al., 2014). In addition, the S protein and its receptor-binding
domain are regarded as promising targets for the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV, even though no vaccine against MERS-CoV is
yet commercially available (Ma et al., 2014a, b).
