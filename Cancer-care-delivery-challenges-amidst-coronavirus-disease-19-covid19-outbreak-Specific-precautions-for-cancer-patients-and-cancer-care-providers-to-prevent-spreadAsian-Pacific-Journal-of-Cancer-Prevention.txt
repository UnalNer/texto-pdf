Coronavirus outbreak has affected thousands of people in at least 186 countries which has affected the cancer care
delivery system apart from affecting the overall health system. Cancer patients are more susceptible to coronavirus
infection than individuals without cancer as they are in an immunosuppressive state because of the malignancy and
anticancer treatment. Oncologists should be more attentive to detect coronavirus infection early, as any type of advanced
cancer is at much higher risk for unfavorable outcomes. Oncology communities must ensure that cancer patients should
spend more time at home and less time out in the community. Oncologists and other health care professionals involved
in cancer care have a critical opportunity to communicate to their patients to pass on right information regarding practice
modifications in view of COVID-19 outbreaks. Countries must isolate, test, treat and trace to control the coronavirus
pandemic. There is a paucity of information on novel coronavirus infection and its impact on cancer patients and cancer
care providers. To date, there is no scientific guideline regarding management of cancer patients in a background of
coronavirus outbreak.

Overview of COVID – 19 outbreak
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
SARS-CoV-2, is a novel coronavirus first detected in
Wuhan, China in December, 2019. (CDC, 2020, March
21; WHO, 2020, January 12). Since then, around 12,784
people have died and more than 2,92,142 confirmed cases
have been reported in at least 186 countries, territories
or areas, according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) by 21st March, 2020. Europe has emerged as a
new epicenter for COVID-19 with mortality and morbidity
increasing daily. Highest number of deaths reported in a
single day in Italy was 793 followed by Spain (285), Iran
(123), France (112) on 21st March 2020. Daily increase
in number of cases and associated mortality has forced
lockdown in various countries to check the spread of
virus. Iran reported its single biggest rise in number of
deaths from the coronavirus as another 147 people died,
raising the country’s overall death toll to 1,135 out of
17,361 confirmed cases in Iran on 18th March 2020 (WHO,
2020, March 21).

In the United States, the virus has now spread to all 50
states, infecting a total of 15219 people with death being
reported in 201 patients by 21st March, 2020. India has
confirmed infection in 396 patients with mortality reported
in 6 patients by 22nd March 2020 (ICMR, 2020, March 22).
Indian authorities did not recommend to expand
coronavirus testing initially, unlike most affected nations.
In view of increasing COVID-19 positive cases, Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revised testing
guidelines on 20th March, 2020 (ICMR, 2020, March 20)
as this was well predicted that limited testing could leave
many of the COVID-19 cases undetected and unnoticed
in the world’s second-most populous country.
These numbers are changing every minute and
incidence and mortality figures will be changed when this
publication goes online. This alarming trend has made
the whole world on lockdown mode. According to WHO,
the new coronavirus so far has an average R0 (contagion
metric) between 2 and 2.5, which means a person infected
with COVID-19 can pass it on to more than two people,

which is more than a seasonal flu (R0 at 1.3), Influenza A
virus subtype H1N1 (R0 at 1.2 and 1.6) and Ebola (R0 at
1.6 to 2), but less than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) (R0 at 4) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) (R0 at 2.5 and 7.2) (Zhao, 2020).
Self- initiated quarantine for 14 days by people
with mild symptoms remains most important public
health intervention, but testing of all suspected cases,
symptomatic contacts of probable and confirmed cases,
would still be required (WHO, 2020, February 11).
Oncological determinants of COVID-19
Cancer patients are more susceptible to COVID-19
in future, than individuals without cancer because of
their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by
the malignancy and anticancer treatments, such as
chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
There will likely be more detailed studies of COVID-19
in future as currently a lot is still unknown about this
disease and how it is spreading. In addition, there has not
been any specific information regarding cancer patients
and COVID-19. However, one study suggested a small
percentage of patients had preexisting conditions including
diabetes (6.4%), hypertension (12.8%), cardiovascular
disease (3.7%), liver diseases (2.7%), malignancy (1.4%),
and others (3.7%) (Cai et al., 2020).
Liang et al., (2020) reported a significantly higher
incidence of severe events i.e. death or ICU admission
requiring invasive ventilation among individuals with a
cancer history than those without (39% vs. 8%; P = .0003),
in 2,007 Chinese patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
However, cancer history was present in only 18 patients,
some of them were long term survivors while others had
active disease. The smaller sample size and associated
co-morbidities in cancer patients contributing to increase
infection susceptibility, made the findings difficult to
interpret. There is no guidelines on care of cancer patients
with cancer types (e.g. breast, lung), therapy types (e.g.
immunotherapy, targeted therapy), or subpopulation of
cancer patients (e.g. children, elderly).
The major risk for cancer patients is the inability
to receive necessary medical services (both in terms
of getting to hospital and provision of normal medical
care once there) because of the outbreak. As per the
Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19,
cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of
COVID-19 than the general population. Patients with
comorbid conditions had much higher rates: 13.2% for
those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4%
for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and
7.6% for cancer (WHO, 2020, February 28).
In a study by Yu et al., (2020) a total of 1,524 cancer
patients at tertiary cancer Institution of Wuhan University
were reviewed in which cancer patients were estimated to
have a 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 in comparison
to the general population. Study results suggested that
hospital visit was a likely factor contributing to the
increased incidence in cancer patients, but incidence
of severe events was not higher than in the general
population.
