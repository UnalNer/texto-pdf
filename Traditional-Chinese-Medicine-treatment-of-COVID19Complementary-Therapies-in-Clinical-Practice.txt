Traditional Chinese medicine

A new kind of Pneumonia caused by new corona virus has been widespread in China since winter of 2019. No
effective treatment for this disease was verified, so the morbidity and mortality rate were supposed higher than
flu. The Traditional Chinese Medicine is widely used in clinical practice in China, but many other countries of the
world to deal with diseases that remain clinically challenging.

This new viral pneumonia was named COVID-19, and declared as
Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. When the COVID-19 broke
out, tens of thousands of Chinese people were infected, especially in
Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province [1], where the infection rate
was extremely high. At present, the cumulative number of diagnoses
worldwide is 645,957. Chinese government made relevant decisions
quickly to control the spread of the epidemic disease. For example, on
January 20, 2020, Chinese government classified COVID-19 as a Class B
infectious disease and treated it as Class A [2].
Supportive therapies are mainly used in clinical practice, such as
oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy and corticosteroid therapy, because
there is no specific effective treatment [3]. According to past experi­
ences in the treatment of infectious diseases in China, Traditional Chi­
nese Medicine, including herbal formulas, can be used to prevent and
treat such infectious disease [4,5]. Therefore, Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China
promptly. Here we introduce the herbal formulas that are commonly
used in Chinese hospitals.
1. Prevention
According to clinical manifestations of patients who infected with
COVID-19, it can be classified as “wet, heat, congestion”, in their lungs.
In Traditional Chinese Medicine, we believe that lungs are delicate, so
the disease first affects lungs’ function.
“Wet” refers to the factor with sticky and heavy turbidity that can
cause a long course of disease and damage the function of the body.
“Hot” refers to the factor with hot, dry, and rising turbidity that can
cause disease. “Congestion” is a causative factor that can congest blood
circulation and cause symptoms such as pain.
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that Qi is the basic substance
that constitutes the human body and maintains basic functions. We
divide Qi into the healthy Qi and the pathogenic Qi. The healthy Qi
refers to substances that maintain the normal operation of our body. The
pathogenic Qi refers to substances that can harm the health of our body.
Therefore, the aim of preventive treatment of TCM is to protect
lungs. Yupingfeng San, a kind of preventative patent medicine, is chosen
because of the nature of the lungs’ diseases, listed in Table 1. Yupingfeng

San is an ancient herbal medicine in TCM and used to protect lung Qi
and avoid pathogenic Qi. In this medicine, there are three herbs:
Astragalus, Fangfeng and Atractylodes. Astragalus can improve lung Qi
and can reduce phlegm. Fangfeng can relieve the pathogenic Qi, remove
dampness and relieve pain. Atractylodes enhances the spleen Qi, which
can affect our digestion and absorption. Previous studies has shown that
Yupingfeng San could regulate the body’s immune function.
These medicinal herbs should be mixed and boiled together with
1000ml pure water for about 15 minutes after boiling to get about 600ml
tincture. Each tincture may be subdivided into three doses and taken
orally 200ml once, three times a day.
2. Treatment of mild infection
Patients with mild infection often has fever, sweat, headache, thirst,
cough, sore throat, red tongue tip, thin white or pale yellow coating and
floating pulse. We base on above symptoms to diagnose if a patient is a
mild one. According to theories of Traditional Chinese Medical, patho­
genic Qi hurts lung Qi. If the lung Qi does not work properly, it will cause
lung heat and dampness and some typical symptoms, including fever,
cough, sore throat and fatigue. So we used the method of “clearing lung
heat and dampness” to treat it. Two types of prescriptions, called Sangju
yin and Yinqiao san, are commonly used in clinical treatment, and are
shown in Table 2. The main function of these two prescriptions is to clear
lung heat, expel phlegm, relieve cough, regulate the patient’s lungs and
restore normal lung function. Clinically, we chose Yinqiao san for pa­
tients who had high fever and Sangju yin for patients who had severe
cough.
These medicinal herbs should be mixed and boiled together with
1000ml pure water for about 15 minutes after boiling to get about 600ml
tincture. Each tincture may be subdivided into three doses and taken
200ml orally once, three times a day.
From some studies, we found that Yinqiao san may have antibacte­
rial and antiviral functions, and can be used to enhance the immune
function of upper respiratory tract [6]. These two prescriptions can be
used to treat patients with mild infection of COVID-19.

for COVID-19, so we use it during the outbreak of COVID-19, and it
works very well clinically.
There is no effective treatment for COVID-19 until now. However,
during the treatment of Covid-19 in China, we found that the inter­
vention of traditional Chinese medicine can reduce the severe symptoms
of patients. The empirical therapy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is
been widely used in Chinese hospitals now, and this therapy might be
useful for people all around the world.

3. Treatment of severe infection

Appendix A. Supplementary data

In the early course of treatment for COVID-19, if the infection cannot
be controlled, worse respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and
death will occur, then serious infection should be considered. These
infectious patients have following main manifestations: high fever,
cough, phlegm, difficult breathing, sweating, chest tightness, fatigue,
nausea, bloating, red or dark red tongue, yellow coating and slippery or
weak pulse. We base on the above symptoms to diagnose if patients are
severe ones.
According to TCM, if early treatments are not effective, patients are
improperly treated, or the pathogenic Qi is too strong, the healthy Qi
(especially the lung Qi) will be damaged severely and lungs will not
work. Therefore, more and more sputum will be produced and patients
cannot breathe anymore. Maxingshigan tang(decoction) and Baihegujin
tang are shown in Table 3 and could be used to benefit the healthy Qi,
expel the pathogenic Qi and help the lung to expel sputum and get air.
These medicinal herbs should be boiled together with 1000ml pure
water for about 30 minutes after boiling to get about 600ml tincture.
Each tincture may be subdivided into three doses and taken orally 200ml
once, three times a day.
Maxinshigan tang is mainly used to clear lung fever and reduce
phlegm. Baihegujin tang can invigorate the lung Qi. We should mix the
two prescriptions together when severe infection happens to benefit the
healthy Qi and expel the pathogenic Qi.

4. Discussion

In 2003, a lot of descriptions of Traditional Chinese Medicine were
used to prevent and treat SARS([7,8]). In 2009, National Administration
of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China issued a Traditional Chinese
Medicine program for treatment of H1N1 infection [9]. Based on these
experiences, we believe that Traditional Chinese Medicine is effective
