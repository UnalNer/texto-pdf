Objectives: Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the
World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [ofﬁcially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the
novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested
therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment.
Methods: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically conﬁrmed infections by
2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed
using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included ‘novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019nCoV’ or ‘COVID-19’.
Results: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8–92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and
endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly
underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, ﬂanked by cough, dyspnoea,
myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral
ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in
the early phases of the disease.
Conclusion: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few
extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities.

During December 2019, a novel Betacoronavirus provisionally
named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and subsequently
ofﬁcially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (or COVID-19),
was associated with a cluster of respiratory tract infections in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] and has rapidly spread across
continents [2,3]. At 17 February 2020, according to surveillance by
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2,3],
71 333 cases have been reported among 29 countries on ﬁve main
continents, and the number of deaths was 1775, almost all
occurring in China (N = 1770; with 1 case in each of the Philippines,
Hong Kong, France, Taiwan and Japan), with a currently reported
fatality rate of between 2–2.3% [2,3]. In this short report, we aimed
to summarise the clinical aspects of the novel Betacoronavirus
infection and its possible manifestations.
