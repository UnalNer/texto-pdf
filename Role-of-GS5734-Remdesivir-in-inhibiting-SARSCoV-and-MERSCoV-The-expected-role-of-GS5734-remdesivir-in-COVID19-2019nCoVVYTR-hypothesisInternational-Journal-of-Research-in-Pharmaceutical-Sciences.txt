Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses related to the family Coronaviridae, the order Nirdovales, and observed in humans and other mammals. In December 2019, many pneumonia cases reported by patients with
unknown causes, mainly associated with seafood and wet animal market in
Wuhan, China, and where clinically resembled viral pneumonia. At present,
there is no existence of antiviral drugs for the treatment of CoV infections. The
results of our study are GS-5734 strongly inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in
HAE cells, GS-5734 inhibits CoVs at early stages in replication by inhibiting
viral RNA synthesis, the absence of ExoN-mediated proofreading in viruses
sensitive to treatment with GS-5734. Protease inhibitors can show improved
outcomes in some coronaviruses, but mostly 99% of protease inhibitors bind
to proteins present in the human body, and only 1% attacks on existed viruses.
The expected role of GS-5734 (Remdesivir) in COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) - VYTR
hypothesis explained. As broad-spectrum drugs are capable of inhibiting CoV
infections, GS-5734 is a broad-spectrum drug and may show inhibition on
CoV infections and COVID-19. GS-5734 will show desired results regarding
antiviral activity against 2019-nCoV as it showed potent antiviral activity in
other CoVs. More clinical trials and experiments needed to prove that GS-5734
(Remdesivir) is a potential and effective drug to treat COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses
related to the family Coronaviridae, the order Nirdovales, and observed in humans and other mammals (Richman et al., 2016). Six coronavirus
species are cause for disease in humans. Preva-

lent four viruses are 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1
cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent people (Su et al., 2016). Remaining two
viruses are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), zoonotic in origin, and cause fatal illness sometimes (Su et al.,
2016). CoVs causes cold and pneumonia before
SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012 from
zoonotic sources (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Zaki et al.,
2012). In December 2019, many pneumonia cases
reported by patients with unknown causes, mainly
associated with seafood and wet animal market in
Wuhan, China, and where clinically resembled viral
pneumonia (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission,
2019). The antiviral drugs, protease inhibitors such
as indinavir, saquinavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, in
the research. Remdesivir, interferon beta are also

examined as possible treatments.
At present, there is no existence of antiviral drugs for
the treatment of CoV infections. In our study, CoV
resistance to the 5- luorouracil (5-FU) and ribavirin
(RBV) in vitro is attributed to their removal by the
proofreading ExoN (Smith et al., 2013), supporting
this potent nucleoside analog must avoid proofreading to intervene with CoV RNA synthesis.
GS-5734 (Monophosphoramidate prodrug), inhibits
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and bat CoV strains which in
replicating in primary human airway epithelial cells
(HAE) and mediate entry using human CoV receptors (Sheahan et al., 2017; Cho et al., 2012; Warren
et al., 2014).
The three objectives of our study are,
1. Role of GS-5734 in inhibiting SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV in HAE cells.
2. Role of GS-5734 in CoVs inhibition at early
stages in replication by inhibiting viral RNA synthesis.
3. The expected role of GS-5734 (Remdesivir) in
the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) – VYTR hypothesis
Role of GS-5734 (Remdesivir)
Inhibition of MHV replication
To describe if GS-5734 inhibits the model B-2aCoV,
in this study, delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells
are infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV).
Treating with elevating concentrations of GS-5734
showed a reduced viral titer till 6-log10, and concentrations of more than 0.7 µM GS-5734 (Figure 1 (A))
did not detect the virus by plaque assay. GS-5734
strongly inhibited MHV with IC50 of 0.05 µM (Figure 1 (B)), maintained consistency with more permeability in cells, and well-organized metabolism
to active triphosphate (TP) by avoiding the ratelimiting irst phosphorylation step.
In our study, low cellular toxicity at required concentrations for antiviral activity of GS-5734, formerly delineated study of cytotoxicity extensively in
human cells, with a CC50 of 41 µm (Figure 1 (C)) and
showing in a selectivity index of >1000. The above
results determine that GS-5734 inhibits MHV replication.
Inhibition in HAE cells
HAE cell cultures are in the biologically pertinent in
vitro lung models, summarizing the complexity of
cells and epithelium physiology in the human conducting airway (Sims et al., 2005). Our research
study described the IC50 values after treatment with
2

GS-5734 in SARS-CoV- infected HAE cultures and
MERS-CoV-infected HAE cultures. Mean IC50 for
two viruses is 0.076 µM for GS-5734 (Figure 2 (A)).
Delaying the addition of GS-5734 until 48 hours (h)
post-infection showed reduced viral titer in HAE cultures for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 2 (B)) at
72 and 96 h post-infection. Cytotoxicity in HAE cultures are not measurable (Table 1).
The above results determine that GS-5734 strongly
inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in HAE cells.
Inhibition of viral RNA synthesis
In our study, cells infected with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell, MHV shows in
a single-cycle disease and treated with 2 µM GS5734 at 2-h intervals from 4 h preinfection to 10
h post-infection. Our study showed, optimal inhibition of if GS-5734 included between 4 h preinfection and 4 h post-infection. Lower inhibition of
GS-5734 if it was included between 6 and 8 h postinfection, and no inhibition of GS-5734 if it included
after 10 h post-infection (Figure 3 (A)). This description clearly shows GS-5734 inhibits CoVs at early in
infection, due to synthesis of viral RNA early in infection and GS-5734 is involved in inhibition of viral
RNA synthesis (Warren et al., 2014; Fehr and Perlman, 2015), after this explained the viral RNA cellular level by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) after treatment
with GS-5734. Treatment with elevating concentrations of GS-5734 showed reduced viral RNA levels
associated with the reduction in titer (Figure 3 (B)).
The above results determine that GS-5734 inhibits
CoVs at early stages in replication by inhibiting viral
RNA synthesis.
ExoN-mediated proofreading
In our study, the resistance of CoVs to the RBV and
5-FU because nsp14 has proofreading ExoN, as prepared ExoN(—) mutant MHV and SARS-CoV are sensitive (Smith et al., 2013). In our study, we made a
comparison of the sensitivity of WT and ExoN(—)
MHV to GS-5734. ExoN(—) MHV described a 100fold more signi icant reduction in viral titer at 0.27
µM GS-5734 compared to WT virus (Figure 4 (A)),
and the measured IC50 for ExoN(—) virus in this
study was 0.021 µM, a 4.5-fold reduced compared
to the WT IC50 of 0.089 µM (Figure 4 (B)). This elevated sensitivity of the ExoN(—) virus to GS-5734 is
the same as other nucleoside analogs and proposes
that GS-5734 is included in viral RNA and separated
by ExoN. Different associations of GS-5734 with the
CoV replicase and template RNA compared with
RBV and 5-FU, with intact proofreading GS-5734,
inhibits CoVs (Smith et al., 2013). The mechanism
is by introducing TP into viral RNA. In our study,

GS-5734 acts early in infection and reduces RNA
levels in a dose-dependent manner, which impairs
viral titer. Results clearly explain the absence of
