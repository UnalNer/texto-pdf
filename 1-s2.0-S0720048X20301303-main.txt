Purpose: To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients with various disease severity.
Methods: The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in
6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease
severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia.
Results: Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT
ﬁndings or manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented
unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular
septal thickening. In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were
found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive "white lung", with atelectasis and
pleural eﬀusion were found in critical type patients (3, 4%). On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities.
Conclusions: Diﬀerent CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratiﬁcation.

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease
mainly involving the respiratory system, which was recently found in
humans [1]. The ﬁrst patient was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China on December 12, 2019. The symptoms of patients were fever,
fatigue, dry-cough and the patients gradually developed severe dyspnea. The majority of them had a good prognosis [2,3], while a mortality rate of 2.1 % has been recently reported [4]. The average incubation period of the disease was found to be 6.4 days [5]. At present,
the diagnosis relies on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) or gene sequencing of sputum, throat swab or lower respiratory tract secretion [6]. However, these methods are time-consuming and do not allow assessing the disease severity. Chest CT

scanning can provide rapid screening and assess the severity. In this
study, we report the CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 of
various severity to provide a more comprehensive overview of the
disease, in order to help the clinical diagnosis and management.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
This retrospective study was approved by our Institutional Ethics
Committee. The data of patients were collected from 6 hospitals in
Anhui province, China from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. The electronic
medical records were reviewed and analyzed. Seventy-three patients
with proven COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 41 males
and 32 females; aged 5–86 years, with mean age of (41.6 ± 14.5)
years. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia (ﬁfth edition) formulated by the National Health
Commission of the People's Republic of China [7]. The CT images and
clinical data of all patients were collected. Among the 73 patients, 54
(74 %) had the travel history to or from Wuhan, 16 (22 %) had a history
of close contact with the local COVID-19 patients before the illness
onset, and the remaining 3 patients denied any contact or travel history.
All patients were administered with anti-viral and supportive treatment, and prevention of complications based on their clinical condition.
