Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a recently described enteric virus with worldwide outbreaks; however, there are
little data available on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and outcome. The study objective was to document case
management of ECoV in adult horses presented to a referral hospital and compare to a cohort of horses that
tested negative for ECoV. A retrospective case series was performed based on positive real-time quantitative
PCR results for ECoV on faeces from horses treated at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1
March 2012 to 31 March 2018. Horses negative for ECoV were matched to the ECoV-positive group as controls.
Data collected included signalment, history, exam ﬁndings, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up.
Thirty-three horses (median age, 11 years; range, 2–37 years) tested ECoV-positive, including three
horses with co-infections. Presenting complaints for ECoV-infected horses included historic fevers
(n = 25/30; 83%), anorexia (n = 14/30; 47%), and colic (n = 13/30; 43%). ECoV-positive horses had
signiﬁcantly lower white blood cell (median, 3.0  109/L; range, 0.68–16.2  109/L), neutrophil (median,
1.26  109/L; range, 0.15–14.4  109/L), and lymphocyte (median, 0.86  109/L; range, 0.42–3.47  109/L)
counts than ECoV-negative horses. Electrolyte and metabolic derangements and scant faeces were
common. Twenty-seven horses were hospitalised for a median of 5 days (range, 0.5–14 days), with 26/27
(96%) horses surviving to discharge. ECoV infection should be a differential diagnosis for adult horses
with fever, colic, anorexia, and leukopenia. The disease has a low mortality rate, but horses may require
intensive care to resolve severe leukopenia, systemic inﬂammation, and metabolic disturbances.

Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is recognised as a cause of fever,
anorexia, lethargy, leukopenia, and gastrointestinal disease in
adult horses (Pusterla et al., 2018). Disease outbreaks have been
reported in adult horses in boarding stables or competitive
facilities across the United States, Europe, and Japan (Oue et al.,
2013; Pusterla et al., 2013; Miszczak et al., 2014; Pusterla et al.,
2018). The recent increase in positive cases likely reﬂects increased
awareness of the virus, and increased availability and timeliness of
testing through fecal real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) (Pusterla et al., 2013).
Many cases of ECoV are self-limiting with transient clinical
signs, however fatalities, endotoxemia and hyperammonemia can
occur (Fielding et al., 2015). Miniature horses may be more
susceptible to severe disease and had a higher fatality rate in an
outbreak (Fielding et al., 2015). In contrast, foals <1 year of age do
not seem to be clinically affected as frequently as adult horses, and
ECoV is often present as a co-infection with other gastrointestinal
pathogens in foals (Slovis et al., 2014).
While data regarding ECoV epidemiology are available, there is
a paucity of data on clinical presentation of cases, diagnosis, and
outcome from a clinical perspective. The purpose of the current
study was to document cases of ECoV diagnosed through fecal
qPCR and presenting to a tertiary referral hospital.
