Abstract: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)
have been reported to use aminopeptidase N (APN) as a cellular receptor. Recently, the role of
APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and
TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of
enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two- to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and
TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression
of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections.
However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV
Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast,
TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor
exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with
neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular
sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV. Treatment of TGEV with NA significantly
enhanced the infection which shows that TGEV is masked by SAs.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses are known as human and animal pathogens that mainly infect the epithelium of the
respiratory or intestinal tract. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis
virus (TGEV), and its variant porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are classified as Alphacoronavirus.
They are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately
28.5 kb. The positive ssRNA serves as mRNA for the generation of viral replicative proteins by
translation of open reading frame (ORF) 1a and ORF1b. The genome contains a 50 untranslated
region (UTR), a 30 UTR, and at least seven ORFs. ORF1a and ORF1b make up two-thirds of the viral
genome and encode the non-structural replicase polyproteins (replicases 1a and 1b), which further
guide the viral replication and translation, regulate cellular processes, and potentially fulfill other
unknown functions. The remaining proximal third of the genome encodes four structural proteins
(spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) by ORF2, ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6,
respectively). The S protein is a type I glycoprotein that projects from the virions surface forming

the corona-like appearance of viral particles. It contains an N-terminal ectodomain (S1) and a short
C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (S2). It is known that the peripheral S1 portion is a globular cellular receptor
binding subunit while the transmembrane S2 portion is required to mediate fusion of viral and cellular
membranes [1]. The S protein also contains important antigenic determinants for coronaviruses. The
triple-spanning M protein has a short N-terminal glycosylated domain, a long C-terminal domain,
and three transmembrane domains [2]. M proteins play key roles in virion assembly/budding. The
lateral interactions between M and E proteins are supposed to mediate the formation of the virion
envelope. The M–S protein interactions are also needed to retain the spike proteins at the budding site,
incorporating the S proteins into the viral envelope [3]. The E protein is a small hydrophobic protein
of 9–12 kDa. It plays crucial roles during virus budding and transiently localizes at the pre-Golgi
compartment before progressing to the Golgi apparatus. Deletion of the E protein in TGEV arrests
virus transportation and maturation [4]. The E protein possesses an ion channel activity, contributing
to virus virulence and pathogenesis [5].
The replication of viruses in their host cells is firstly mediated by the virus binding to the cellular
receptors. Some Alphacoronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), feline infectious
peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), TGEV, and PEDV, may use aminopeptidase N
(APN) as a cellular receptor [6–10]. APN is a type II cell membrane metalloprotease, that is linked
to cells by its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It is highly abundant on the brush border membrane
of the mature small intestinal enterocytes, kidney, and liver epithelial cells. APN is highly species
specific. Human coronaviruses cannot recognize porcine APN as a cellular receptor because of certain
differences in glycosylation regions [11]. APN has been identified as a major receptor for TGEV, as
it has been shown that TGEV virions are able to specifically bind to purified APN and conferred
the infectivity of TGEV to a non-permissive cell line when the cells were expressing recombinant
APN [7]. An interaction between APN and PEDV infection has also been demonstrated. Transient
expression of APN in Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells conferred susceptibility of these
cells to PEDV infection and the infection was inhibited by anti-APN polyclonal antibodies [9]. Cong
and colleagues demonstrated that APN mediates PEDV infection in Vero E6 and in an immortalized
porcine enteric cell line [12]. However, increasingly more data demonstrates that APN is not essential
for PEDV infection, because PEDV exhibits no binding to soluble APN [13,14]. Moreover, Vero cells
are commonly used for PEDV propagation and cultivation in vitro. The endogenous expression of
APN in Vero cells was undetectable in the mRNA and the protein levels, which challenges the role of
APN as a cellular receptor for PEDV. Therefore, whether APN is a functional receptor for PEDV is
disputable. However, no data are available on the role of APN in primary enterocytes.
In addition to APN, a sialic acid binding capacity has been reported for TGEV and PEDV [15,16].
Sialic acids are electronegatively charged monosaccharides in animals and some microorganisms.
They are prominently positioned at the outer end of N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipids.
TGEV shows a hemagglutinating activity with α-2,3-linked sialic acids on the erythrocyte surface as
target. Among different types of sialic acids, N-glycolylneuraminic acid was recognized by TGEV
more efficiently than N-acetylneuraminic acid [15]. Sialic acid binding by TGEV is not essential
in the initiation of infection of cultured cells, as TGEV mutants lacking sialic acid binding activity
can be propagated to the same extent in cultured cells [15]. However, sialic acid binding activity is
important for the enteropathogenicity of TGEV. Mutants without sialic acid binding were not capable of
initiating intestinal infection in vivo, showing that sialic acid binding is required for efficient intestinal
infections [17]. This sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is supposed to help the virus to penetrate the
mucus layer and to infect intestinal epithelial cells. PEDV is also able to bind sialic acids. PEDV S1
protein was reported to bind bovine and porcine mucins that contain a mixture of different types of
sugar [16,18]. Furthermore, Neu5Ac was identified as the most favored binding sugar of PEDV S1
by a glycan array screen [16]. Different from the APN binding domain in the C-terminal of PEDV S1
(residues 477–629), the sialic acid binding domain was reported in the N-terminal of PEDV S1 (residues
1–320) [18].

In the present study, the co-culture system of primary porcine enterocytes that was established in
our laboratory was used to study the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infection in their target cells [19].
Further, it was investigated whether sialic acids are cellular receptors for TGEV in primary enterocytes.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cells, Viruses, and Reagents
Primary porcine enterocytes were isolated from the ileum of three-day-old piglets and co-cultured
with porcine myofibroblasts [19]. Euthanizing piglets was done in agreement with the European
legislation on animal experiments. All experimental procedures were approved by the Local Ethical
Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University (EC2013/97), and all methods
were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. The enterocytes were maintained with
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s-F12 Ham medium (DMEM-F12). TGEV Purdue and Miller grown on
swine testicle (ST) cells and PEDV CV777 strain grown on Vero cells were used in this study. PEDV
CV777 fecal suspension was collected from a three-day-old infected suckling piglet. A twenty percent
fecal suspension was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1000 U/mL penicillin
(Continental Pharma, Puurs, Belgium), 1 mg/mL streptomycin (Certa, Braine l’Alleud, Belgium),
1 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco BRL, Merelbeke, Belgium), and 0.01% v/v fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Braine l’Alleud, Belgium). Hydrocortisone, spermidine, and Wnt agonist were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma, St-Louis, Mo, USA). Porcine insulin was purchased from Protein specialists
(ProSpec, Rehovot, Israel). The small intestinal contents (IC) were collected from the duodenum of a
three-day-old suckling piglet. After euthanasia, a 20 cm long segment of duodenum was closed by
two surgical clamps and was removed from a piglet. Then, one clamp was removed and the intestinal
contents were released from the lumen into a 15 mL centrifugation tube. In order to collect all the
intestinal contents, the lumen was washed once by filling it with 5 mL Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) containing 1000 U/mL penicillin, 1 mg/mL streptomycin, 1 mg/mL gentamicin, and
0.01% v/v fungizone. Then, the DMEM was released from the lumen into the 15 mL tube that already
contained the intestinal contents. After centrifugation (1200 rpm, 10 min at 4 ◦ C), the supernatant of
the intestinal contents was collected and stored at −20 ◦ C until use.
2.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy
Three- and seven-day-old primary porcine enterocytes were fixed in HEPES-buffered glutaric
aldehyde (Sigma, St-Louis, Mo, USA) for scanning electron microscopy as described previously [20].
After 24 h fixation, the samples were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at room temperature
(RT), followed by ascending grades of alcohol dehydration. In order to avoid the water vaporization
obstructing the electron beam and interfering with image clarity, the dehydrated samples were
transferred to a critical point drier (CPD, Bal-tec, Balzers, Liechtenstein) for complete drying. Finally,
the dried samples were mounted on a metal stub and were sputter-coated with platinum. The microvilli
of all the samples were acquired with a JEOL JSM 5600 LV scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan).
2.3. Treatment of Primary Enterocytes with Hydrocortisone, Spermidine, Porcine Insulin, Wnt Agonist, or
Small Intestinal Contents
Twenty-four h post co-cultivation, monolayers of enterocytes were cultured with medium
containing hydrocortisone (1 and 10 µg/mL), spermidine (50 and 500 µM), insulin (1 and 10 µg/mL),
Wnt agonist (0.1 µM), or intestinal contents (1%) for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and immunofluorescence staining was conducted for APN expression analysis.

2.4. Immunofluorescence Staining of the APN Expression in Primary Enterocytes
Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-porcine APN antibodies (IMM013; kindly
provided by Prof. Eric Cox, Ghent University) containing 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at 37 ◦ C,
followed by goat anti-mouse-IgG FITC labeled antibodies for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. Nuclei were stained
with Hoechst for 10 min at RT. The percentage of APN positive cells were analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy (Leica Microsystems GmbH).
2.5. Infection Experiment
At twenty-four h of co-cultivation, monolayers of enterocytes were treated with 1 µg/mL
hydrocortisone, 50 µM spermidine, 1 µg/mL insulin, 0.1 µM Wnt agonist, or 1% intestinal contents for
another 24 h. Then, the susceptibility of treated enterocytes to PEDV and TGEV was tested. Cells were
inoculated with 200 µL of TGEV Miller at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 and 200 µL of the
PEDV CV777 Vero adapted strain at 105.6 TCID50 /mL or 107 viral RNA copies/mL of fecal suspension
with 10 µg/mL trypsin. After 60 min of incubation at 37 ◦ C, unbound viral particles were removed
by three washing steps with DMEM. Cells were further incubated in medium containing 1 µg/mL
hydrocortisone, 50 µM spermidine, 1 µg/mL insulin, 0.1 µM Wnt agonist, or 1% intestinal contents for
24 h (37 ◦ C, 5% CO2 ) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence staining.
2.6. Co-localization Analysis of Viral Antigens with APN by Confocal Microscopy
To determine the co-localization of viral antigens and APN, co-cultured enterocytes were infected
with TGEV Miller and Purdue and PEDV Vero adapted and non-adapted strains. After 24 h incubation,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and immunofluorescence staining was performed.
Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-porcine APN antibodies containing 10% normal
goat serum for 1 h at 37 ◦ C, followed by goat anti-mouse-IgG1 FITC labeled antibodies for 1 h at 37 ◦ C.
Then, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT and incubated with mouse
monoclonal anti-porcine PEDV antibodies (kindly provided by Prof. Luis Enjuanes, National Center
for Biotechnology) or swine polyclonal anti-TGEV antibodies [19] containing 10% normal goat serum
for 1 h at 37 ◦ C, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG2a AF594 labeled antibodies or goat anti-swine Texas
Red labeled antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst for 10 min at RT and the
results were analyzed by a Leica TCS SPE laser scanning spectral confocal system linked to a DM B
fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems).
2.7. Neuraminidase Treatment of Cells and Virus
To remove SAs from enterocytes, monolayers of co-cultured enterocytes were washed three
times with warm DMEM. Then, cells were incubated with 50 mU/mL NA from Vibrio Cholerae
(Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) at 37 ◦ C for 1 h. Cells that were mock-treated were
incubated with DMEM and underwent the same manipulations as NA-treated cells. To remove SAs
from the virus, virus suspensions were incubated with 50 mU/mL NA from Vibrio Cholerae at 37 ◦ C
for 1 h. the mock-treated virus was incubated in DMEM and underwent the same manipulations as
the NA-treated virus. Afterwards, cells were inoculated with either NA-treated or mock-treated virus
(m.o.i of 1 for TGEV Purdue and Miller). After 60 min incubation at 37 ◦ C, cells were washed three
times with medium and further incubated in medium for 24 h (37 ◦ C, 5% CO2 ). Then, cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Immunofluorescence was performed to measure the
percentage of infected cells. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT. Then,
cells were incubated with swine polyclonal anti-TGEV antibodies containing 10% normal goat serum
for 1 h at 37 ◦ C, followed by goat anti-swine-IgG FITC labelled antibodies for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. Nuclei
were stained with Hoechst for 10 min at RT. The percentages of infected cells were determined by
fluorescence microscopy.

2.8. Co-localization of TGEV and SAs
To determine the co-localization of viral antigens and SAs, co-cultured enterocytes were infected
with TGEV Miller and Purdue. After 24 h incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and a double immunofluorescence staining was performed. Cells were incubated with
biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II (Vector laboratories) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. The lectin was subsequently
stained with Streptavidin-FITC (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. Then, cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT and incubated with swine polyclonal anti-TGEV antibodies containing
10% normal goat serum for 1 h at 37 ◦ C, followed by goat anti-swine-IgG Texas Red labeled antibodies.
Nuclei were stained with Hoechst for 10 min at RT and results were analyzed by a Leica TCS SPE laser
scanning spectral confocal system linked to a DM B fluorescence microscope.
2.9. Binding Assays
To characterize the attachment of TGEV to primary enterocytes, direct virus-binding studies were
carried out with TGEV particles. Cells were chilled on ice for 5 min and washed three times with
DMEM. Then, cells were inoculated with TGEV Miller and Purdue particles at a m.o.i. of 10 for 1 h
at 4 ◦ C. Unbound virus particles were removed by three washings with DMEM. Cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and a double immunofluorescence staining was performed.
Cells were incubated with biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II or mouse monoclonal anti-porcine
APN antibodies for 1 h at 37 ◦ C, followed by Streptavidin-FITC or goat anti-mouse-IgG1 FITC labeled
antibodies for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. Then, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT and
incubated with swine polyclonal anti TGEV antibodies containing 10% goat serum for 1 h at 37 ◦ C,
followed by goat anti-swine-IgG Texas Red labeled antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst for
10 min at RT and the results were analyzed by a Leica TCS SPE laser scanning spectral confocal system
linked to a DM B fluorescence microscope.
2.10. Statistical Analysis
Data were statistically processed by SPSS (t-test). The data are represented as means with
standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Results with p-values of <0.05 were
considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Aged Enterocytes Carry More Microvilli, Express More APN, and Demonstrate Increased Susceptibility to
TGEV and PEDV Infection
The percentages of microvilli positive enterocytes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy.
A higher percentage of microvilli positive cells (89%) was observed at seven days cultivation compared
to three days cultivation (66%). The expression of APN at seven days cultivation (28.7 ± 2.3%) was
significantly higher than at three days cultivation (14.8 ± 3.2%; Figure 1A,B). The data suggest that
primary enterocytes underwent a differentiation process in vitro. They terminally differentiate into
mature enterocytes during the long cultivation time. Next, enterocytes were inoculated with TGEV and
PEDV at three and seven days of cultivation. The results showed that a significantly higher infection
was detected in enterocytes at seven days cultivation (Miller: 3.6 ± 1.1%; Purdue: 7.3 ± 0.7%) than
at three days cultivation (Miller: 0.7 ± 0.7%; Purdue: 3.5 ± 0.5%) for TGEV. An increased trend of
infection was detected in enterocytes at seven days cultivation (39 infected cells per well) than at three
days cultivation (16 infected cells per well) for PEDV but without significance (p = 0.06; Figure 1C).

APN expression. However, both PEDV and TGEV did not only infect APN positive enterocytes, but
target primary porcine enterocytes. We found that a higher infection of PEDV and TGEV was
correlated with a higher APN expression. However, both PEDV and TGEV did not only infect APN

Viruses 2020, 12, 402

14 of 18

also APN negative cells. Our results demonstrated that PEDV and TGEV may use another additional
unknown receptor for entry in primary enterocytes.
The epithelium of the small intestines is continuously and rapidly renewed in a process involving
cell generation and migration from the multi-potent stem cells in the crypts to the differentiated cells at
the tips of the villi within 2–3 days. In our study, after three days cultivation, the primary enterocytes
were positive for sucrase and iso-maltase, which are considered as differentiation markers for epithelial
cells [19]. However, the expression of aminopeptidase N was only around 11%, indicating that the
primary enterocytes are not fully mature at three days cultivation. Therefore, we analyzed APN
expression in enterocytes at a later time point (seven days cultivation). A significantly higher expression
of APN was detected at seven days cultivation compared to three days cultivation. Interestingly, the
seven-day-cultured enterocytes with a higher APN expression showed significantly higher infection
to TGEV than that of enterocytes cultured for three days. This agrees with the fact that the virus
mainly infects and destroys mature enterocytes lining the villi of small intestines [23]. However, the
infection efficiency of PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells was still low, indicating that other factors than
APN need to be considered for PEDV infection. Therefore, several positive enterocyte differentiation
factors were tested. Hydrocortisone plays an important role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and
carbohydrates, and is a known promoter for differentiation of cultured cells. Hydrocortisone was found
to be a critical factor for the differentiation of skeletal muscle, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells [24].
Sorrell and colleagues demonstrated that hydrocortisone significantly upregulated the expression of
APN in human dermal fibroblasts [25]. Besides, Wnt signaling is required for the formation of normal
crypt-villus units of intestines, and stimulates the differentiation of intestinal secretory epithelial
cells [26]. Activated Wnt signaling has also been shown to promote mesenchymal differentiation [27].
The original rationale for including intestinal contents in our primary cell cultures was trying to mimic
the in vivo situation in the intestinal tract. Intestinal contents contain a large number of enzymes, such
as: Amylase, which digests carbohydrates to monosaccharides; pancreatic enzymes, which digest
proteins into amino acids; and lipase which digests fats. It has been demonstrated that intestinal
contents play an important role in virus infection. The proteases (trypsin) in the intestinal contents
activate rotavirus infection by cleaving the outer capsid protein VP4 [28]. The propagation of porcine
enteric calicivirus (PEC) on a cell line critically relies on the presence of intestinal contents in the
culture medium [29]. Chang et al. demonstrated that the bile salts in intestinal contents are essential
for growth of PEC by inducing the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway [30]. In our study, the
intestinal contents collected from the upper duodenum promoted the expression of APN and enhanced
the infection of both TGEV and PEDV, especially the CV777 Vero adapted strain. Further investigation
is needed to determine which growth-promoting factor in the intestinal contents is responsible for the
increase of coronavirus infection.
To date, coronaviruses use four different proteins as cellular receptors. Mouse hepatitis virus
(MHV) initiates the infection by binding to the carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocyte
membranes and intestinal brush border membranes [31]. Next, APN was found to act as a receptor
for porcine, feline, canine, and human coronaviruses [6]. The receptors for the highly pathogenic
human respiratory viruses SARS-CoV type 1 and type 2 as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) [32,33].
Cong and colleagues proved that the porcine small intestine epithelial cell line was more susceptible to
PEDV when a high expression level of APN was present, and that interference with APN expression
in epithelial cells inhibited PEDV infection, demonstrating that APN serves as an essential receptor
for PEDV [12]. In addition, a transgenic mouse model expressing porcine APN was proven to be
susceptible to PEDV, which confirmed that APN plays a role as the cellular receptor for PEDV [34]. In
our study, we found that the higher infection of PEDV in enterocytes is correlated with higher APN
expression. Both aged enterocytes and enterocytes treated with differentiation factors expressed more
APN and were more susceptible to PEDV, which indicates that APN may play role in PEDV infection
in enterocytes. Moreover, we found that the APN was expressed at the apical surface of enterocytes

Viruses 2020, 12, 402

15 of 18

and PEDV infected 40 times more enterocytes at the apical surface than at the basolateral surface
(supplementary Figure S1). These results were in agreement with the previous finding that PEDV
enters polarized cells via the apical membrane [12]. Our results indicate that APN facilitates the entry
of PEDV into primary enterocytes. Shirato and colleagues indicated that APN may promote PEDV
replication in porcine kidney cell line, CPK cells via its protease activity [14]. How APN facilitates
PEDV infection in enterocytes should be further investigated. However, due to the fact that other
molecules besides APN will also be expressed at the apical plasma membrane during differentiation,
they may also contribute to the higher susceptibility of differentiated enterocytes. Recently, increasingly
more data has been published that show that APN is not a cellular receptor for PEDV. Overexpression
of APN in non-susceptible cells did not confer susceptibility of the cells to PEDV and knocking out
APN in susceptible cells did not abrogate PEDV infection, which indicates that APN is not required
as a cellular receptor for PEDV in vitro [13,14,22]. Furthermore, APN knockout pigs retained their
susceptibility to PEDV confirming that PEDV may use another additional receptor in pigs [35]. In
agreement with these findings, we found that PEDV can infect APN negative primary enterocytes,
which further confirmed that a cellular receptor different from APN exists in enterocytes for PEDV
replication. The primary enterocytes isolated and cultured in our study are not 100% positive for
APN, as we not only get the villi epithelial cells, but also the crypt epithelial cells during our isolation
procedure. By immunofluorescence staining of ileum tissue of a three-day-old piglet, we observed
that the villi epithelial cells are APN positive, while the crypt epithelial cells are APN negative (data
not shown). As PEDV has been shown to infect goblet cells and crypt stem cells in addition to villous
mature enterocytes [36], we believe that PEDV may also use another cellular receptor besides APN
to infect intestinal cells. Taken together, our results indicate that although APN could significantly
promote PEDV infection in enterocytes, an additional cellular receptor exists in enterocytes for PEDV
replication. Since ACE2 is expressed in the gut epithelial cells, it will be tested in the near future if it
can function as a PEDV receptor.
In addition to PEDV, APN has been identified as a major cellular receptor for TGEV. In the present
study, it was shown that a higher expression of APN significantly increased the replication of TGEV in
enterocytes, indicating that APN plays an important role as a cellular receptor for TGEV. Whitworth
and colleagues demonstrated that APN knockout pigs were resistant to TGEV infection, indicating
that APN is the sole functional receptor for TGEV [35]. However, we found that except APN positive
enterocytes, TGEV could also infect APN negative enterocytes, suggesting that an additional receptor
also exists in enterocytes for TGEV. The result obtained in our in vitro experiment may not fully reflect
the in vivo experiments, as the in vivo situation is composed of a complex set of cells and tissues. The
Purdue strain used in our study has been passaged 114 times in primary kidney cells and a nucleotide
mutation (T to G at nucleotide position 1753), which causes a serine (S) to alanine (A) at aa 585 [37,38].
This mutation may be correlated with the cell adaptation and also it may result in a broader cell tropism
of the adapted strain, which may explain that the virus is able to grow more efficiently in APN negative
cells. Purdue has been proven to infect primary colon epithelial cells and porcine myofibroblasts, which
are both negative for APN [19]. In vivo, TGEV shows a higher cell tropism to villous enterocytes of
newborn piglets compared to older pigs and causes only high mortality in the early life of piglets. Since
APN is present on enterocytes from both newborn and older pigs, the age-dependent susceptibility
to TGEV infection may be caused by an additional receptor that is specifically present in newborn
piglets. Taken together, we hypothesize that APN is the determinant cellular receptor for TGEV, but an
additional receptor exists in young piglets. Apart from APN, TGEV also uses SA as an attachment
mediator on the cells. Shahwan and colleagues have shown that NA treatment of jejunum epithelial
cryosections did not reduce the TGEV Spike protein binding in vitro and were doubting on the role
of SA during infection [39]. In our study, removal of SA from intestinal cells had no effect on TGEV
infection, showing that terminal SA residues are not receptor determinants for TGEV. Removal of SA
from TGEV virions significantly enhanced the viral infectivity in vitro. This indicates that SA on the
virion surface masks the binding site of the viral protein to cellular receptors. Removal of SA from

Viruses 2020, 12, 402

virions facilitates TGEV to bind to its functional receptor on the enterocyte membrane. To confirm the
role of APN and SA in TGEV infection in primary enterocytes, a binding assay was performed in this
study. The results demonstrated that both TGEV Miller and Purdue could bind to APN positive and
SA positive cells. Meanwhile, Miller and Purdue could also bind to APN negative and SA negative
enterocytes. Furthermore, our study showed that APN and SA double-negative enterocytes could be
infected by TGEV Miller and Purdue (supplementary Figure S2), which suggests that besides APN and
SA, TGEV can use another cellular receptor for the replication in enterocytes. Further investigation
will focus on identifying this unknow receptor. A binding assay for PEDV could not be conducted due
to the low titer of the virus stock.
5. Conclusions
Based on our previously established primary enterocyte co-culture system, which is very relevant
for the in vivo situation, it was shown that a higher expression of APN on the enterocytes resulted in
a higher infectivity of TGEV and PEDV. However, TGEV and PEDV could also infect APN negative
enterocytes, indicating that an additional receptor exists in enterocytes besides APN. TGEV did not
show binding activity on SAs on the surface of enterocytes. These new insights stimulate the search for
unknown receptors for PEDV and TGEV, which can assist further research on antiviral intervention.
