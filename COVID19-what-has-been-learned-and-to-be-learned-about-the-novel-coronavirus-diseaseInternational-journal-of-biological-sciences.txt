The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and
elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans. Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which
caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes
similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than
SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than
women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article
attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will
cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of
the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding
and eradication of the threatening disease.
Key words: Coronavirus, pneumonia, outbreak, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19

The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has
become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory
to all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for all
the holiday and for many weeks after due to the
outbreak of a novel viral disease. The virus is highly
homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by
the World Health Organization (WHO) on February
11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV
Disease-19 (COVID-19) [1]. The epidemic started in
Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the
entire country and to near 50 others all over the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over
80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than
40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients
who died. WHO warns that COVID-19 is “public
enemy number 1” and potentially more powerful
than terrorism [2].
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200
papers have been published on COVID-19 including
its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and
treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that
determined the sequence of the virus isolated from
multiple patients [3]. This review attempts to
summarize the research progress in the new and
swiftly developing subject area. Whenever possible,
we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and
another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012). We will also
discuss what we have learned so far regarding the
prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as
some remaining yet urgent questions.

The outbreak
CoVs have been traditionally considered
nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing
approximately 15% of common colds [4]. However, in
this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic
human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003

and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon
spread to many other countries with horrible
morbidity and mortality [5]. Therefore, the current
COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded
history of humans.
As shown in Fig. 1, clusters of pneumonia that
had unknown origins were first reported from Wuhan
on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health
Commission [6]. Seven days later the sequence of the
CoV was released [7]. On January 15, 2020 the first
fatal case from Wuhan was reported [6]. Meanwhile,
the epidemic rapidly spread to the neighboring cities,
provinces, and countries. On January 20, the infection
of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that

1754
human-to-human transmission was possible [8]. On
January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with
all its public transportation stopped. On January 24
the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out
of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct
contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was
considered the starting site of the infection from an
unknown animal source [6]. On January 30, WHO
declared the outbreak a global health emergency. By
the time of this report, the disease has already spread
throughout China and near 50 other countries all over
the world (Fig. 2). As the situation is rapidly evolving,
the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to
be determined.

On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on

patients presented a more updated illustration of the
epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/

Physicochemical properties
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2
are largely not yet known. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment
and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity
[24-26]. SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to
ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether,
75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant,
peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents,
but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the
virus [27].

Immune responses to CoVs
The entire human population generally lacks
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and hence is susceptible to
the novel virus. Currently, no detailed study has been
reported regarding the immunological response to
SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we can only refer to previous
studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV (Fig. 4). In general, after a virus invades
the host, it is first recognized by the host innate
immune system through pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like

receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-Ilike receptor (RLR) [28]. Through different pathways,
the virus induces the expression of inflammatory
factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of
type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spreading of
the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of
viral antigens [28]. However, the N protein of SARSCoV can help the virus escape from the immune
responses [29].
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the
fight against the virus. T lymphocytes including CD4+
and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the
defense. CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce
virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill
virus-infected cells. T helper cells produce
proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending
cells. However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by
inducing apoptosis of T cells. The humoral immunity
including complements such as C3a and C5a and
antibodies is also essential in combating the viral
infection [30,31]. For example, antibodies isolated
from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV [32].
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune
system generates a large number of free radicals
locally that can cause severe damages to the lungs and
http://www.ijbs.com


other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ
failure and even death [33].

Clinical features
The incubation periods
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, featured by
clustering onset, is more likely to affect elderly people
with comorbidities and pregnant women [8]. It is
common that for people who are exposed to a large
number of viruses or whose immune functions are
compromised, they have higher chance to be infected
than others. The estimated mean incubation period of
SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a
study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan [36]. However, a
study on 1,099 cases demonstrates that the incubation
period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24
days [8]. A more recent study, as described above,
demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8
(3.0-7.2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases
[37]. It is very important for health authorities to
adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most
accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected
but symptomless people from transmitting the virus
to others [38]. As a common practice, individuals
exposed to, or infected by, the virus are usually
required to be quarantined for 14 days. Should the
quarantine time be extended to 24 days?

Symptoms
Fever is often the major and initial symptom of
COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no
symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough,
shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache,
sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea,
and vomiting. Some patients experienced dyspnea
and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the
disease [8]. In severe cases, patients quickly
progressed to develop acute respiratory syndrome,
septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and
acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging

abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for
early diagnosis [39-41].
A demographic study in late December of 2019
showed that the percentages of the symptoms were
98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea,
and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the patients required
ventilation support [42]. Similar findings were
reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and
a cluster caused by transmission from an
asymptomatic individual [43,44]. Comparably, a
demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV
patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and
dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms. However,
80% of them required ventilation support, much more
than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the
higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19. Diarrhea
(26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with
MERS patients. In SARS patients, it has been
demonstrated that fever (99%-100%), dry cough
(29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%),
and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms
and ventilation support was required for
approximately 14%-20% of the patients [45].
By February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 was
2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS by November
2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases [46]. For
MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012,
the mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases [47].
An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2
was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval
(CI) of 5.71-7.23 [48], whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV
only ranged from 2 to 4 [49]. A comparison of SARSCoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding
their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in
Table 1. The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2
has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two [6].
Thus, it is much more challenging to control the
epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than those of MERS-CoV
and SARS-CoV.


Diagnosis
Patient history
Clustered onset often happens in the same
family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a
cruise ship. Patients often have a history of travel or
residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact
with infected individuals or patients in the recent two
weeks before the onset [50]. However, it has been
reported that people can carry the virus without
symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients
discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again
[51], which sends out an alarm to increase the time for
quarantine.

Laboratory results
Patients have normal or reduced number of
peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes)
at the early stage. For example, lymphopenia with
white blood cell count < 4×109/L including
lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate
aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in
1,099 COVID-19 patients [8]. The levels of liver and
muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the
blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and
erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the
blood of most patients [52]. In patients with severe
cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation
product present in the blood, was elevated, and
lymphocyte count was progressively reduced [34].

Radiography
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in
most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral
patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute
lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) [34]. When ARDS happens, uncontrolled
inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive
fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes
decreases the surfactant level and increases surface
tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to
expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse [53,
54]. Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings
often parallel the most severe extent of the disease
[55].

patient who died of the disease, consistent with the
pathology of viral infection and ARDS [56] and
similar to that of SARS and MERS patients [57,58].

Nuclear acid assays
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of
COVID-19. However, due to the high false-negative
rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical
manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which
no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) in China on
February 13, 2020. A similar situation also occurred
with the diagnosis of SARS [59]. Therefore, a
combination
of
disease
history,
clinical
manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological
findings is essential and imperative for making an
effective diagnosis. On February 14, 2020, the Feng
Zhang group described a protocol of using the
CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARSCoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA
fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L
(10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick
in less than an hour without requiring elaborate
instrumentation [60]. Hopefully, the new technique
can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and
convenience if verified in clinical samples.

Treatment
Due to the lack of experience with the novel
CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care
to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of
therapies that have been used or proposed before for
the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2). These
therapies include current and potential treatments
with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids,
plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine,
and psychological support. Even plasma from
recovered patients was proposed to be used for
treatment [61]. Pharmaceutical companies are racing
to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus
[62].

Supportive care
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the
beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser
degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the
http://www.ijbs.com


gastrointestinal system and the kidneys. Nevertheless,
respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major
threat to the patients and the major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the
symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen
therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation,
and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the
severity of the disease. Patients with severe
respiratory symptoms have to be supported by
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a
modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for
the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory
failure. In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte
balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary
infection and septic shock, and the protection of the
functions of the vital organs are also essential for
SARS-CoV-2 patients [7].

Tackling cytokine storms
It has been known that a cytokine storm results
from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS
and MERS patients [33]. Cytokine storm is a form of
systemic inflammatory response featured by the
release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β,
IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1. These
cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast
number of free radicals which are the major cause of
ARDS
and
multiple
organ
failure
[67].
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of
cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6
monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat
cytokine storm [68]. Other immunosuppression
treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation
of T cell-directed immune response; the blockade of
IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition [69];
blinatumomab [70]; suppressor of cytokine signaling
4 [71]; and HDAC inhibitors [72].
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely
used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity
of inflammatory damage [65]. However, steroids at
high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury
in SARS and COVID-19 patients [59,73]. Instead, they
may cause severe side effects, especially avascular
osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis
[74]. Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at
low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be
used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients
[75].

Antiviral therapy
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral
therapy has been confirmed. However, intravenous
administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog,
has been found to be efficacious in an American
patient with COVID-19 [64]. Remdesivir is a novel
antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the
treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg
viruses [76]. Later, remdesivir also demonstrated
possible inhibition of other single stranded RNA
viruses including MERS and SARS viruses [77,78].
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to
China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2infected individuals [79], and the results are highly
anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/
ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as
potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory
symptoms [80,81]. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver
damage, and other adverse reactions can occur
following combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir
[80]. The interaction of these treatments with other
drugs used in the patients should be monitored
carefully.

Plasma from recovered patients and antibody
generation
The collection of the blood from patients who
recovered from a contagious disease to treat other
patients suffering from the same disease or to protect
healthy individuals from catching the disease has a
long history [82]. Indeed, recovered patients often
have a relatively high level of antibodies against the
pathogen in their blood. Antibodies are an
immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to
fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they
recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and
neutralize them directly [83]. Based on this, plasma
was collected from the blood of a group of patients
who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into
10 seriously ill patients. Their symptoms improved
within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced
inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen
saturation in the blood. However, verification and
clarification are necessary to propose the method for
http://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020, Vol. 16
large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet
developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some
disadvantages associated with the plasma should be
considered carefully. For example, antibodies can
overstimulate the immune response and cause
cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a
life-threatening toxicity [84]. The concentration of
antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the
demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill
patients. It is difficult to develop and produce specific
antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global
epidemic [62]. Thus, it is more critical and practical to
isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the
genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen
for effective antibodies against essential proteins of
the virus. This way, we can readily scale up the
production of the antibodies.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases
in China for thousands of years. However, its effects
largely rely on a combination of multiple components
in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of
a disease based on the theories of TCM. Most of the
effective components remain unknown or are vague
as it is difficult to extract and verify such components
or their optimal combinations. Currently, due to the
lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19,
TCM has become one of the major alternative
treatments for patients with light to moderate
symptoms or for those who have recovered from
severe stages [85]. For example, Shu Feng Jie Du
capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were
found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment [86].
Top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients
were observed in several provinces in China that used
TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu
(63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas
Hubei province, which used TCM in only
approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the
lowest cure rate (13%) [87]. However, this is quite a
rough comparison as many other impact factors such
as the number and severity of the patients should be
included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and coworkers
published a study to compare western medicine
(WM) treatment alone with combined treatment of
WM and TCM [88]. They found that the times needed
for
body
temperature
recovery,
symptom
disappearance, and hospitalization were remarkably
shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only
group. Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic
worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably
lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM only

1760
group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was
lower in the WM+TCM group than WM only group
(8.8% versus 39%). Nevertheless, the efficacy and
safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at
larger scales and in more centers. It would also be
intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions
and clarify the effective components of TCM
treatments or their combinations if possible.

Mental health care
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious
and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also
experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever,
hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the
treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids
can lead to more anxiety and mental distress. In the
early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of
psychiatric
morbidities
including
persistent
depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor
excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even
suicidality were reported [89,90]. Mandatory contact
tracing and quarantine, as a part of the public health
responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make
people more anxious and guilty about the effects of
the contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their
families and friends [66].
Thus, mental health care should be provided to
COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and
people in contact with them as well as the general
public who are in need. The psychological support
should include the establishment of multidisciplinary
mental health teams, clear communications with
regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak and treatment plans and the use of
professional electronic devices and applications to
avoid close contact with each other [66].

Vaccination
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting
the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and
infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often
complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of
epidemics caused by emerging viruses. Efforts have
been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to
generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies
and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV [81,
91]. Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in
animal models for SARS [92]. However, the in vivo
efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly
individuals and lethal-challenge models and their
protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to
be determined before a clinical study is initiated. This
is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago

and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS
continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to
other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic
sources in endemic areas. Vaccination strategies have
been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus,
DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like
particles and recombinant protein subunits and some
have been evaluated in animal models [93]. The
development of a safe and effective vaccine against
SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent
and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty
because of the long period of time (averaged 18
months) needed for vaccine development and the
dynamic variations of CoVs.
