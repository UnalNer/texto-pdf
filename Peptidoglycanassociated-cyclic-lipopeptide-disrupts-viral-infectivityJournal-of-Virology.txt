Enteric viruses exploit bacterial components, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG), to facilitate infection in humans. Because of their
origin in the bat enteric system, we wondered if severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also
use bacterial components to modulate infectivity. To test this question, we incubated CoVs with LPS and PG and evaluated infectivity, ﬁnding no change following
LPS treatment. However, PG from Bacillus subtilis reduced infection ⬎10,000-fold,
while PG from other bacterial species failed to recapitulate this. Treatment with an
alcohol solvent transferred inhibitory activity to the wash, and mass spectrometry revealed surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, as the inhibitory compound. This antibiotic had robust dose- and temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity.
Mechanistic studies indicated that surfactin disrupts CoV virion integrity, and surfactin
treatment of the virus inoculum ablated infection in vivo. Finally, similar cyclic lipopeptides had no effect on CoV infectivity, and the inhibitory effect of surfactin extended
broadly to enveloped viruses, including inﬂuenza, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, Una,
Mayaro, Dugbe, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Overall, our results indicate that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin has broad viricidal activity and suggest that
bacteria by-products may negatively modulate virus infection.

infection. Taking cues from studies of enteric viruses, we initially investigated how
bacterial surface components might improve CoV infection. Instead, we found that
peptidoglycan-associated surfactin is a potent viricidal compound that disrupts virion integrity with broad activity against enveloped viruses. Our results indicate that
interactions with commensal bacterial may improve or disrupt viral infections, highlighting the importance of understanding these microbial interactions and their implications for viral pathogenesis and treatment.

charides (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG) to enhance its thermostability and receptor
afﬁnity, facilitating in vivo infection (3). Antibiotic depletion of commensal bacteria
inhibited oral poliovirus infection, but was rescued by recolonization, pretreatment of
virus with LPS, or bypassing the enteric system through intraperitoneal injection (3).
Other viruses, including reovirus, mouse mammary tumor virus, and murine norovirus,
have been shown to use similar mechanisms to facilitate infection (3, 4). Together, these
results indicate a key role for commensal bacteria in improving infectivity and pathogenesis of enteric viruses.
Like the enteric system, the respiratory tract harbors high levels of commensal
bacteria, particularly in the upper respiratory tract, including the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and oropharynx (1). While poorly understood, the respiratory microbiome is
complex, with differentiated bacterial communities inhabiting each niche (1). Like the
enteric version, the respiratory microbiome plays a protective role in immunity (1).
Nevertheless, a recent study demonstrated that inﬂuenza can interact with several
pathogenic bacterial infections, increasing their adherence to respiratory cells and
increasing bacterial colonization and disease in vivo (5). These results provide evidence
that viral pathogens can interact with bacteria in the respiratory tract as well as in
the gut.
Although they are human pathogens, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have their
evolutionary origins in the bat enteric system (6) and may have, like human enteric
viruses, exploited commensal bacteria. Given the high levels of commensals in the
respiratory tract (1), it is possible that such interactions may have been maintained
during emergence of CoV strains. Thus, we wondered if CoVs utilized bacterial components to facilitate infection. Previous work had identiﬁed a key role for the toll-like
receptor (TLR) pathways in immunity to SARS-CoV, with the absence of LPS binding
TLR4 or its downstream adaptors resulting in augmented disease (7–9). Given the
interactions observed between enteric viruses and bacterial components, CoVs may
also use similar microbial components to improve infectivity and subsequently stimulate the TLR4 response.
In this study, we explored the relationship between bacterial surface components
and CoV infection. Surprisingly, we found that PG from Bacillus subtilis reduced CoV
infectivity. Using mass spectrometry, we identiﬁed a cyclic lipopeptide (CLP), surfactin,
as the molecule responsible for CoV inhibition. The inhibitory effect of surfactin was
dose and temperature dependent, with treatment disrupting the integrity of the CoV
particle. Notably, surfactin treatment of the inoculum ablated CoV infection in vivo, but
prophylactic treatment had no effect. Other similar CLPs had no effect on CoV infectivity, suggesting that the viricidal properties of surfactin were unique. Importantly,
surfactin treatment reduced the infectivity of several other enveloped viruses, including
that of inﬂuenza A, Zika, Dugbe, Nipah, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, chikungunya, Mayaro, Una, and Ebola viruses. Together, these results demonstrate the efﬁcacy
of surfactin as a viricidal compound and highlight the potential for microbial environment to modulate virus infection.

RESULTS
Peptidoglycan derived from B. subtilis reduces with coronavirus infectivity.
Given their origins in bat enteric systems, we wondered if CoVs might be stabilized by
bacterial components (6). To test this possibility, human CoV-229E, a common coldassociated CoV, and MERS-CoV were treated with control (phosphate-buffered saline
[PBS]), LPS (Escherichia coli), or PG (Bacillus subtilis), and viral infectivity was determined
(Fig. 1A). In contrast to its effect on enteric viruses, LPS had no effect on CoV infectivity;
however, the presence of PG from B. subtilis dramatically reduced the infectivity of both
HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1B). The structure of PG varies considerably between
bacterial species (11), suggesting that PG from different bacteria may have distinct
effects on CoV infectivity. To explore this, we tested a diverse set of bacterially derived

PGs for the ability to modulate CoV infection (Fig. 1C). Notably, only PG derived from
B. subtilis reduced HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that interference
with CoV infectivity is not shared by PG from all bacterial species.
Next, we wondered if incubation temperature also played a role in B. subtilis PG
reduction of CoV infectivity. To investigate, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV stocks were
treated with B. subtilis PG at room temperature (RT), 32°C, or 37°C (Fig. 1D and E).
Interestingly, PG disruption of viral infectivity was reduced at lower temperatures. For
HCoV-229E, infectivity had a stepwise reduction with increasing temperature (Fig. 1D).
In contrast, PG reduction of MERS-CoV infectivity was ablated at lower temperatures,
with no signiﬁcant loss of viral infectivity at either RT or 32°C (Fig. 1E). Together, these
data indicate that the inhibitory effect of B. subtilis PG is inﬂuenced by incubation
temperature.
Infectivity inhibition can be disassociated from PG. Two possible scenarios
explain why only B. subtilis PG reduces CoV infectivity: (i) B. subtilis PG reduces
infectivity directly, using unique structural features absent in PG from other bacteria, or
(ii) the PG preparation contains another compound that mediates inhibition. To differentiate these possibilities, we exploited the poor solubility of PG, washing it in a variety
of solvents to separate its inhibitory effect (Fig. 2A). After three washes in PBS, PG
maintained its reduction of HCoV-229E infectivity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PG washed with
either 100% ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) lost the ability to inhibit HCoV-229E
infectivity (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the washes either modiﬁed the inhibitory
capacity of PG or removed a soluble compound responsible for reducing CoV infectivity. To explore this, the supernatants from clariﬁed PG samples were incubated with
HCoV-229E (Fig. 2B). While the PBS, PBS control, and ethanol control had no inhibitory
effect, the ethanol supernatant from PG potently reduced viral infectivity of HCoV-229E
(Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that a soluble compound distinct from, but
present in, the PG sample is responsible for reducing CoV infectivity.
Mass spectrometry identiﬁes the inhibitor as surfactin. Having isolated the
inhibitory molecule, we utilized mass spectrometry to determine its identity. Unwashed

FIG 2 Identiﬁcation of surfactin from B. subtilis peptidoglycan. (A and B) PG from B. subtilis in a PBS
solution was clariﬁed, washed with the indicated solvents, and clariﬁed again. Supernatants were
decanted and retained, while the insoluble fractions were resuspended in PBS. The (A) insoluble fraction
and (B) supernatants were then used to treat HCoV-229E, and relative infectivity was determined (n ⫽ 3).
(C, D, and E) Mass spectrometry was performed on PG (C) and ethanol wash (D). The peak corresponding
to the molecular mass of 1,058 kDa in the ethanol wash was then further fragmented (E) to determine
the identity of the molecule. Representative spectra are shown (n ⫽ 3). For all dot plots, the centered bar
represents the group mean and error bars the SD.

B. subtilis PG and ethanol supernatants were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization–tandem time of ﬂight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS)
(Fig. 2C). In the PG samples, three prominent peaks were observed with respective
molecular masses of 1,010.5, 1,058.7, and 1,238.6 kDa (Fig. 2C). While all of these peaks
were present in the ethanol supernatant, the compound with a mass of 1,058.7 was
enriched nearly 10-fold (Fig. 2D). Further analysis of this peak by fragmentation
produced a spectrum matching that of the cyclic lipopeptide surfactin (12), a potent
biosurfactant produced naturally by B. subtilis and shown previously to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties (13, 14) (Fig. 2E; for structure, see Fig. 6A). Given its
abundance and enrichment in the ethanol wash, as well as its described antiviral
properties, we concluded that surfactin likely conferred the B. subtilis PG with the ability
to interfere with CoV infection.
Reduction of CoV infectivity by surfactin is temperature- and dose-dependent.
To conﬁrm its inhibitory effect, we characterized the ability of puriﬁed surfactin to
reduce CoV infectivity. HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV were treated with PBS or
surfactin at either RT, 32°C, or 37°C. For all three CoVs, surfactin reduced infectivity after
treatment at 37°C, with a nearly complete loss of infectious virus (Fig. 3A to C). Similarly

FIG 3 Characterization of CoV inhibition by surfactin. (A) HCoV-229E, (B) MERS-CoV, and (C) SARS-CoV
(MA15) were treated with PBS alone (black) or 100 ␮g/ml surfactin (red) and at room temperature (RT),
32°C, and 37°C, and infectivity was determined (n ⫽ 3). HCoV-229E (D) and MERS-CoV (E) were treated for
the indicated time at 4°C (blue), RT (red), 32°C (green), or 37°C (purple), and infectivity was determined
(n ⫽ 3). (F) HCoV-229E (blue), MERS-CoV (orange), and SARS-CoV MA15 (green) were diluted in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 200 ␮g/ml, and viral infectivity was determined (n ⫽ 3). For dot plots, each

to B. subtilis PG (Fig. 1D and E), the degree of reduction varied based on incubation
temperature and varied between the CoVs (Fig. 3A to C). To further characterize the
kinetics of inhibition, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV were treated with surfactin at 4°C, RT,
32°C, or 37°C, and sampled to measure time-dependent neutralization (Fig. 3D and E).
At both 32°C and 37°C, surfactin rapidly reduced HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, with a
nearly complete loss of infectivity after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 3D and E). In contrast, RT
incubation reduced CoV infectivity more slowly, and the effects of surfactin were
ablated at 4°C. We also observed dose-dependent changes in surfactin activity against
HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, higher concentrations of
surfactin were required for inhibition of HCoV-229E compared to that for inhibition of
either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, whose inhibition curves were nearly identical. Together,
these data indicate that both temperature and dose impact the inhibitory effects of
surfactin.
Surfactin reduces CoV infectivity by disrupting the structural integrity of viral
particles. With clear inhibition of coronavirus infectivity by surfactin treatment, we next
explored mechanism of action. We initially considered the possibility that surfactin
disrupted spike/receptor binding activity, thus disrupting infection. We explored
whether levels of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein spike or its receptor DDP4 were affected
by surfactin treatment. DPP4 levels were assayed by ﬂow cytometry in HUH7 cells, a line
known to be permissive to MERS-CoV infection. Brieﬂy, HUH7 cells were treated with

surfactin. Cells were then incubated with a recombinant MERS-S1-Fc, stained with an
anti-Fc-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) secondary antibody, and total FITC staining
was measured by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 4A). Surfactin- and PBS-treated cells had nearly
identical ﬂuorescent intensities, suggesting that surfactin treatment has no effect on
DPP4 levels. Similarly, Western blot analysis of treated stock virus demonstrated that
surfactin treatment had no effect on MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein protein concentrations (Fig. 4B). Together, these data suggested that both the host receptor and the viral
spike glycoprotein were not disturbed by surfactin treatment.
Using prior studies, we identiﬁed two other mechanisms for viricidal activity,
namely, disruption of the viral membrane or inhibition of host-virus membrane fusion
(13–15). Therefore, we examined if virion integrity was maintained by performing RNase
I protection assays. Following surfactin treatment, particles were exposed to RNase I to
digest exposed viral RNA; samples were subsequently extracted for RNA, and relative
viral RNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR).
Increasing surfactin concentrations correlated with a decrease in viral RNA and viral
titer for both HCoV-229E (Fig. 4C) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4D), despite having no effect on
MERS-CoV spike protein levels (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that disruption of virion
integrity is the primary mechanism by which surfactin inhibits CoV infection. To conﬁrm
these results, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on HCoV-229E
treated with 10, 15, 20, and 100 ␮g/ml surfactin or PBS. In control-treated samples,
numerous intact HCoV-229E particles could be visualized (Fig. 4E to G). As surfactin
concentration increased, fewer virions were observed by TEM, with few intact virions
being observed in 20 ␮g/ml and none in 100 ␮g/ml surfactin-treated samples (Fig. 4F).
Notably, numerous round, deﬂated structures of similar diameter as the HCoV-229E
virions could be found in the 15- and 20-␮g/ml samples, which may represent disrupted virions (Fig. 4G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that surfactin
inhibits CoV infection primarily through the disruption of viral particles.
In vivo characterization of surfactin on CoV infection. With no approved therapeutics (16), emerging, zoonotic CoVs pose a signiﬁcant threat to public health (17, 18).
Numerous in vivo studies have demonstrated that surfactin is tolerated at higher
concentrations than in vitro cytotoxicity experiments with erythrocytes would suggest
(19, 20). Additionally, our own in vitro cytotoxicity experiments have demonstrated that
other cell lines tolerate surfactin at higher levels than those tolerated by erythrocytes.
Together, this suggests that surfactin may have therapeutic potential. Therefore, we
wanted to examine the potential of surfactin to treat infections in vivo. We reasoned
that virions must interact with the respiratory microbiome upon release and transmission. To model this interaction, we tested whether direct treatment of the inoculum
reduced in vivo infection and disease. SARS-CoV (104 PFU) was treated with PBS or
surfactin and used to infect BALB/c mice intranasally (i.n.). Mice were monitored over
4 days for weight loss and lethality, with lung titers determined at 2 and 4 days
postinfection. As expected, animals infected with PBS-treated virus experienced rapid
weight loss and exhibited high lung titers at both 2 and 4 days postinfection (Fig. 5A).
In contrast, mice infected with surfactin-treated SARS-CoV lost no weight, and no
infectious virus was detected in their lungs (Fig. 5B). Additionally, mock-infected mice
receiving surfactin alone demonstrated no signs of disease or weight loss, suggesting
that surfactin treatment alone does not have any pathological effects (Fig. 5A).
To examine therapeutic potential, we next evaluated if pretreatment with surfactin
could reduce respiratory CoV disease. BALB/c mice were treated i.n. with 50 ␮l of either
PBS control or surfactin daily, starting 18 h prior to infection and continuing over the
ﬁrst 2 days of infection. Mice were subsequently infected with 104 PFU of SARS-CoV
(MA15) and monitored for weight loss and lethality, with lung titer determined at 2 and
4 days postinfection. In contrast to the surfactin-treated inoculum, prophylactic surfactin treatment had no effect on weight loss (Fig. 5C) or viral titer in the lung (Fig. 5D).
These results indicate that prophylactic surfactin treatment by this route does not
reduce SARS-CoV disease in this mouse model.

Effects of other cyclic lipopeptides on CoV infectivity. Surfactin belongs to a
family of 80 natural antibiotic compounds referred to as cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) (13).
While structurally diverse, all CLPs share two key features, a nonpolar hydrocarbon tail
and a non-ribosomally produced peptide ring (13, 14). While many CLPs have been
found to be antifungal and antibacterial, antiviral properties have not been described
except for surfactin, (13, 14). Therefore, we tested six additional CLPs for the ability to
reduce CoV infectivity (Fig. 6A). Despite similar biochemical structures, none of the CLPs
tested had a signiﬁcant effect on HCoV-229E or MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 6B). These
results suggest that unique features allow surfactin to reduce CoV infectivity.
Surfactin broadly reduces viral infectivity. With its potent antiviral properties
against CoVs, we next tested the effect of surfactin against other highly pathogenic
viruses. Given its ability to disrupt virion integrity, we focused on enveloped viruses
from diverse families, including two inﬂuenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2), Zika virus
(ZIKV), Dugbe virus (DUGV), Nipah virus (NiV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus
(CCHFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Mayaro virus, Una virus, and Ebola virus (EBOV).
As a negative control, we tested the nonenveloped coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Each virus
was treated with either PBS or surfactin, and viral infectivity was determined. As
expected, surfactin had no effect on the nonenveloped CVB3 (Fig. 6C). In contrast,
surfactin signiﬁcantly reduced infectivity in each of the enveloped viruses (Fig. 6C), but
the magnitude of effect was not uniform. Most enveloped viruses were reduced either

to below their limit of detection or more than 100,000-fold. In contrast, Mayaro virus,
both inﬂuenza strains, and EBOV exhibited some resistance, having their infectious titer
reduced by only 2.6, 2.7, 2.4, and 1.6 logs, respectively. These data suggest that while
surfactin treatment broadly reduced the infectivity of enveloped viruses, factors beyond the mere presence or absence of an envelope may govern overall sensitivity.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we explored the relationship between bacterial components and CoV
infection. While initially predicting enhanced infection, treatment with B. subtilis PG
reduced CoV infectivity, while envelope components from other bacteria had no effect.
Separating the inhibitory effect using solvent washes, we used mass spectrometry to
identify that the CLP surfactin was responsible for reduced CoV infectivity and disruption of virion integrity. Unfortunately, despite efﬁcacy against the inoculum, prophylactic surfactin treatment prior to infection had no effect on CoV-related disease in vivo.
Notably, other CLPs had no effect on CoV infectivity despite having similar biochemical
structures. Finally, we found that surfactin treatment was efﬁcacious against many
enveloped viruses in vitro, including inﬂuenza A virus (IAV) strains H1N1 and H3N2,
ZIKV, DUGV, NiV, CCHFV, CHIKV, Una virus, Mayaro virus, and EBOV. Together, these
data demonstrate that surfactin is a potent virucide and highlight that interactions with
bacterial derived compounds can also negatively modulate virus infection.

Over the last two decades, surfactin has been shown to be antibacterial, antifungal,
and antiviral (13, 14, 19, 21, 22). Mechanistically, the broad antimicrobial efﬁcacy of
surfactin has been linked to disruption of lipid membranes (15). However, more
recently, researchers describing the efﬁcacy of surfactin against the animal CoV porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) suggested that surfactin inhibited viral-host membrane
fusion (19). Concentration of surfactin may explain the distinct mechanisms. In our
studies, a higher surfactin dose (100 ␮g/ml) corresponded to virion destruction and a
⬎10,000-fold reduction in CoV infectivity (Fig. 4C and D). In contrast, the PEDV study
used a lower surfactin concentration (20 ␮g/ml), which corresponded to fusion inhibition based on intact particles and membrane integration assays (19). However, they
reported only limited changes in viral load based on percent reduction in PFU. Our
examination at the lower surfactin dose (20 ␮g/ml) found intermediate results with less
reduction in CoV infectivity (10-fold reduction) but also a corresponding loss of viral
RNA following RNase I treatment (Fig. 4C and D). TEM at this dose indicated the
presence of both intact and disrupted virions. Together, the results suggest that virion
structure may be maintained at this lower concentration but that virion integrity has
been compromised in a subset of particles. Notably, the 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) for surfactin varies within the human respiratory CoVs, with HCoV-229E (32.5 ␮g/
ml) requiring a higher dose than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (18.9 and 16.8 ␮g/ml,
respectively). This fact suggests that PEDV, an enteric CoV, may have increased resistance to surfactin-like molecules due to posttranslational modiﬁcations, including lipid
composition or glycosylation state, possibly contributing to differences in mechanistic
ﬁndings.
Similarly to the question of mechanism, in vivo efﬁcacy of surfactin also varied
between PEDV and human CoVs. While surfactin ablates SARS-CoV disease when
treating the inoculum, prophylactic treatment was not protective. The failure of surfactin to protect mice against SARS-CoV is puzzling, given the efﬁcacy of prophylactic
oral surfactin treatment against PEDV disease (19). One explanation is that intranasal
(i.n.) surfactin administration is not efﬁcient in delivery to the lower respiratory tract.
Branching of the airway may result in uneven distribution of surfactin, and prior studies
have shown that intranasal instillation achieves only 50% efﬁciency at delivery to the
lower respiratory tract (23, 24). In contrast, oral administration efﬁciently delivers
compounds to the gastrointestinal system and is especially effective for lipopeptides,
which persist within the intestines (25, 26). Dosing may also play an important role in
distinguishing the differences in disease outcome, with oral treatment of the gut
permitting a much higher dose (20 mg/kg every 3 hours) than intranasal delivery
(0.5 mg/kg 2 times a day) (19). To overcome these problems, futures studies should use
higher doses or more effective delivery methods, such as intubation or the inhalation
of an aerosolized surfactin. Alternatively, several surfactin derivatives exist that enhance
its viricidal activity and decrease its hemolytic activity (13, 14, 27). Using a derivative
with higher activity and speciﬁcity may compensate for inefﬁcient delivery or dose
restriction. It is also possible that tissue-speciﬁc differences between respiratory tract
and gut may limit access of surfactin to free virions. However, without further manipulation and understanding, surfactin is not yet a tangible target for therapeutic
treatments of respiratory CoV infection.
In addition to CoVs, we examined the viricidal efﬁcacy of surfactin against other
enveloped viruses, discovering broad efﬁcacy but wide variation. While all tested
enveloped viruses were sensitive to surfactin treatment, IAV strains H1N1 and H3N2,
Mayaro virus, and EBOV demonstrated a degree of resistance. These data suggest that
factors beyond the mere presence of a viral envelope regulate surfactin efﬁcacy. One
possible factor is the lipid content of the viral envelope. Previous studies have shown
that membranes enriched in cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) are resistant to surfactin permeabilization, while membranes containing phosphatidylcholines (PC) are more sensitive (28). The envelope of inﬂuenza A viruses have been
reported to be enriched for both cholesterol and PE (29), providing support for this
hypothesis. Unfortunately, the lipid content of the other viruses tested have not been

determined, preventing direct comparison. Nevertheless, some broad observations are
worth mentioning. CoVs, ZIKV, and bunyaviruses (CCHFV and DUGV) derive their
envelopes from either the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum, organelles enriched in surfactin-sensitive PC (30). NiV (31), IAV (32), and EBOV (33) are thought to
derive their envelopes from lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, which could specify
their lipid content and thus surfactin sensitivity. Alphaviruses such as CHIKV, Mayaro,
and Una also bud from the plasma membrane, although neither the lipid content nor
the involvement of lipid rafts has been explored (34). Together, these observations
suggest that the lipid content of enveloped viruses may explain their differential
sensitivity to surfactin.
The failure of other CLPs to reduce CoV infectivity is also surprising, given the
structural similarity to surfactin. In particular, iturin A is biochemically similar to surfactin and has also been reported to disrupt lipid membranes (Fig. 6A) (13). A possible
explanation involves differences in their mechanisms of action. Surfactin penetrates
lipid layers, alone solubilizing and permeabilizing them (15). In contrast, iturin A must
interact with sterol components to cause membrane permeabilization, explaining its
broad antifungal activity but only selective antibacterial activity (13). However, iturin A
is also quite hemolytic (13, 14), making it unclear why the membranes of enveloped
viruses grown in mammalian cells would not also be susceptible to this mechanism due
to the presence of sterols. Compounding this mechanistic uncertainty, daptomycin’s
permeabilization of membranes requires no such interaction, but CoVs are resistant to
its effects as well (35) (Fig. 6B). The results argue that surfactin possesses unique
properties that confer its viricidal activity.
The temperature sensitivity of the viricidal properties of surfactin is interesting, as it
implies that temperature modulates the physical interaction between surfactin and the
CoV particle. Molecular dynamics simulation suggest that temperature governs both
the 3-dimensional “horse saddle” structure of individual surfactin molecules and shape
of surfactin micelles (36). Thus, one explanation for the temperature-sensitive viricidal
activity of surfactin is that the speciﬁc structural conformations necessary to disrupt
virion integrity only occur at higher temperatures. Alternatively, temperature could
modulate the speciﬁc structure of the CoV virus itself. Virions are dynamic structures
that undergo “viral breathing,” whereby they undergo large structural ﬂuctuations that
are often required for infection (37). Importantly, viral breathing can be enhanced by
incubation at higher temperatures (37). While viral breathing has not been examined in
the context of CoVs, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of both the SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer ﬂuctuates between lying and standing positions,
demonstrating the ﬂexibility of CoV structural proteins (38). Thus, it is possible that, at
lower temperatures, CoVs adopt a conformation that sterically hinders surfactin from
accessing the viral membrane, preventing disruption. Future studies are necessary to
differentiate between these possibilities in order to fully understand the implications of
the temperature dependent effects of surfactin.
While the use of surfactin as a treatment proved ineffective for respiratory infection,
surfactin may have potential utility as a disinfectant. Its rapid activity against an array
of enveloped viruses offers a rapid and effective means to inactivate infectious samples.
In contrast to other detergent- and heat-based approaches, inactivation with surfactin
would be expected to only act on membranes, maintaining protein-protein interactions
and allowing a range of further studies. Similarly, the relatively low cost and lack of
corrosive effect could permit its use in a variety of locations, including health care,
school, and home settings. While bacterial resistance might normally be a concern, the
existence of several resistant species already limits its utility as an antibiotic for
treatment (39). While dosing and efﬁcacy against different virus families is required,
these factors offer surfactin as a potent viricidal disinfectant moving forward.
Overall, while the microbiome has historically been thought to serve a protective
role against pathogens (1, 2), recent studies with viruses complicate this view. Studies
with poliovirus demonstrated that the presence of commensal bacteria is necessary for
oral poliovirus infection in mice (40). Similar ﬁndings with other enteric viruses suggest
jvi.asm.org 11

that utilizing bacterial components is a common approach. In contrast, our results add
further complexity, demonstrating that surfactin, a secondary metabolite of B. subtilis,
can potently reduce CoV infectivity. Although B. subtilis is not generally part of the
human microbiome (41), it is often used as an intestinal probiotic and has been found
to transiently persist in the gut (42). Additionally, surfactin-like molecules are produced
by a broad array of bacterial species (13, 43–45). For example, the novel surfactin-like
CLP coryxin was recently found to be produced by Corynebacterium xerosis, a common
member of the respiratory microbiome (45). These facts suggest that microbial components typically thought to work against bacterial competitors could also potentially
disrupt viral infection. Thus, as the relationship between the microbiome and viral
infections is further explored, the role that bacterial metabolites such as surfactin and
other CLPs play in modulating infection must be considered in viral disease. Overall,
these results highlight the dynamic microbial environment and its potential to impact
viral pathogenesis, as well as for identifying novel inhibitory factors for therapeutic use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viruses, cells, and in vitro infection. HCoV-229E, provided by the World Reference Center for
Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA), was propagated on HUH7 cells grown in Dulbecco’s
minimal essential medium (DMEM; Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and 1% antibioticantimycotic (A/A) (Gibco). Titration was performed by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) in HUH7
cells and calculated by the Spearman-Karber method. MERS-CoV (EMC-2012 strain) (46) and recombinant
SARS-CoV (MA15) (47) were titrated and propagated on VeroCCL81 and VeroE6 cells, respectively, which
were grown in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% A/A. Standard plaque assays were used for
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (48, 49). Coxsackievirus B3 (50) and chikungunya (51), Nipah (52), Dugbe (53),
Zika (54), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (53), inﬂuenza A H1N1 (A/California/04/09) and H3N2
(A/Panama/2007/99) (55), and Ebola (56) viruses were propagated and quantitated via standard methods.
All experiments involving infectious virus were conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch
(Galveston, TX) in approved biosafety level 2, 3, or 4 (BSL) laboratories and animal facilities, with routine
medical monitoring of staff.
Treatment with bacterial surface components and cyclic lipopeptides. CoVs were diluted 10%
(vol/vol) in solutions with ﬁnal concentrations of 1 mg/ml (PG and LPS) or 100 ␮g/␮l (CLPs) unless
otherwise speciﬁed in the text. For alcohol wash experiments, samples were instead diluted 5% (vol/vol).
Treated samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C, after which they titer was determined. The
following bacterial components were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli (catalog no. L4130), peptidoglycan Bacillus subtilis (catalog no. 69554), Staphylococcus aureus
(catalog no. 77140), Streptomyces species (catalog no. 79682), and Micrococcus luteus (catalog no. 53243).
Peptidoglycan from Escherichia coli (PGN-EB) was purchased from InvivoGen. For each surface component, stock solutions were created by suspending the component in PBS and then stored at –20°C. The
cyclic lipopeptides surfactin (catalog no. S3523), iturin A (catalog no. I1774), fengycin (catalog no.
SMB00292), polymyxin B (catalog no. P1004), colistin (catalog no. C4461), ramoplanin (catalog no. R1781),
and daptomycin (catalog no. D2446) were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PBS was selected as a
vehicle based on solubility data from previous studies, which established that surfactin is soluble in PBS
at levels well above the concentrations used here (57–59).
Mass spectrometry. Stock peptidoglycan was centrifuged at 15,000 ⫻ g for 1 min in a tabletop
centrifuge, and the insoluble PG fraction was then resuspended in 100% ethanol. Following a 5-min
incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant and insoluble fractions
were used for treatment of viruses or delivered to the mass spectrometry core facility. Peptidoglycan
(1 ␮l) was combined 1:1 with a 10 mg/ml ␣-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (60% acetonitrile) and spotted
onto MALDI targets. All MALDI-MS experiments were performed using a 5800 MALDI-TOF/TOF system
(Applied Biosystems). The MS data were acquired using the reﬂectron detector in positive mode (700 to
4,500 Da, 1,900 Da focus mass) using 300 laser shots (50 shots per subspectrum). Collision-induced
dissociation tandem MS spectra were acquired using 1 kV of collision energy. Fragmentation data were
analyzed manually to determine structural information.
Flow cytometry. DPP4 levels were measured by ﬁrst incubating HUH7 cells with 100 ␮g/ml of
surfactin. Cells (2.5 ⫻ 105) were then incubated with 15 ␮g/ml of puriﬁed recombinant MERS-CoV S1
fused to the Fc region of human IgG, followed by incubation with anti-human IgG-FITC (catalog no.
F9512; Sigma-Aldrich). Flow cytometry was performed on a Guava easyCyte 8HT system (Luminex), and
data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.6.1.
Western blot analysis. MERS-CoV was inactivated by diluting viral stock in AV lysis buffer and 10 mM
EDTA-0.9% SDS in a 1:1:1 ratio before heating at 95°C for 15 min. Equal volumes of inactivated virus then
underwent electrophoresis by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF)
membranes. MERS-CoV spike levels were determined using a MERS-CoV (NCoV/novel coronavirus) spike
antibody (catalog no. 40069-RP01; Sino Biologicals) and measured using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (catalog no. 7074S; Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were developed
using enhanced chemiluminescence Clarity Max reagent (Bio-Rad) and imaged using the ChemiDoc MP
imaging system (Bio-Rad). Image processing was done using ImageLab 6.0.1 (Bio-Rad).

Transmission electron microscopy. HCoV-229E virions were visualized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) through negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate (60). Brieﬂy, 200-mesh Formvar
carbon-coated copper grids (catalog no. FCF200-CU; Electron Microscopy Sciences) were treated for 20
min with HCoV-229E samples. Excess sample solution was then wicked off with ﬁlter paper, and each grid
was then stained for 45 s with 2% uranyl acetate solution. Excess stain was again wicked off with ﬁlter
paper. Grids were then dried and visualized on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Images
were recorded with a Gatan Orius SC200 charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera. In order to ensure even
counting, 10 pictures were taken on 3 different cells on each grid for each replicate. No more than 10
min was allotted for looking for virions in each cell.
RNase I protection assay. Assays were performed in accordance with standard protocols described
previously (61). Brieﬂy, samples were treated with 250 U RNase I for 30 min. To halt RNA digestion and
inactivate RNase I, a 2⫻ volume of viral RNA buffer (catalog no. R1034-1-100; Zymo Research) with
2-mercaptoethanol was added. RNA was then extracted using the Quick-RNA viral kit (catalog no. R1035;
Zymo Research). RNA was then converted into cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (catalog no.
170-8891; Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR
Green Supermix (catalog no. 172-5271; Bio-Rad). HCoV-229E speciﬁc primer sequences were forward,
5-TGACATTCGCGACTACAAGC-3, and reverse, 5-TAACGGTGGTTTGGCTTTTC-3. MERS-CoV speciﬁc
primer sequences were forward, 5-TCGCTTGGCAAATGAGTGTG-3, and reverse, 5-ACATTAGCAGTTGT
CGCCTG-3.
Statistical analysis. All statistical comparisons in this study involved the comparison between 2
groups, untreated control virus and peptidoglycan/surfactin-treated virus. Thus, signiﬁcant differences in
viral titer, RNA levels, and weight loss were determined by the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.
Ethics statement. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for care and
use of animals by the Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health. The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) approved the
animal studies under protocols 1711065 and 1707046.
Mice and in vivo infection. Ten-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories and maintained in SealSafe HEPA-ﬁltered air in/out units. Animals were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane and infected intranasally (i.n.) with 104 PFU in 50 ␮l of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). Infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease, and
lung titers were determined as described previously (62). For experiments involving prophylactic
treatment with surfactin, 50 ␮l of 100 ␮g/ml surfactin-PBS was administered i.n. to anesthetized
animals 18 h prior to infection, with additional treatments on day 0, day 1, and day 2. Infected
animals were weighed daily, and lungs were collected 2 and 4 days postinfection for downstream
analysis by plaque assay.
