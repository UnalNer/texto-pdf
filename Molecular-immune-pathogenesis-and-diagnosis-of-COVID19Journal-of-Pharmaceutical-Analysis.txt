Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a kind of viral pneumonia with an unusual outbreak in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been marked as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic
coronavirus into the human population after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the twenty-ﬁrst century. In
this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss
current knowledge of molecular immune pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 on the base
of the present understanding of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, which may be helpful in offering
novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pathogenesis

Novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia, which was named as
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO on the February
11, 2020, has rapidly increased in epidemic scale since it ﬁrst
appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1]. On the same day,
the international virus classiﬁcation commission announced that
the novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is not the ﬁrst severe
respiratory disease outbreak caused by the coronavirus. Just in the
past two decades, coronaviruses have caused three epidemic diseases, namely, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2]. At present, the
cases of COVID-19 have been found in many countries around the
world [3]. According to the latest data, up to the March 1, 2020, the
number of conﬁrmed cases in China reached 79,968, of which 2,873
were dead, and 41,681 were cured. In addition to China, the number
of conﬁrmed cases in other countries also reached 7,041, of which
105 were dead, and 459 were cured. On the 31st of January 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19
was listed as the Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC), meaning that it may pose risks to multiple
countries and requires a coordinated international response. The
review tries to explain the molecular immune pathogenesis and
diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide a reference for the prevention
and drug development of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the
recent research progress of SARS-CoV-2 and the knowledge from
researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
2. Virology of SARS-CoV-2
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive sense
single-stranded RNA genome (26e32 kb) [4]. Four coronavirus
genera (a, b, g, d) have been identiﬁed so far, with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) detected in the a coronavirus (HCoV-229E and
NL63) and b coronavirus (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1) genera [5]. In late December 2019, patients presenting with cough, fever, and dyspnea with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) due to an unidentiﬁed microbial infection were
reported in Wuhan, China. Virus genome sequencing of ﬁve patients with pneumonia hospitalized from December 18 to
December 29, 2019, revealed the presence of a previously unknown
b-CoV strain in all of them [6]. This isolated novel b-CoV shows 88%
identity to the sequence of two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
